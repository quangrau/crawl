She spent much of her time swimming to ships that had fallen to the bottom of the sea.\u00a0 The ships held treasures from the world above! She would fill her arms and set up her collection here and there. All the while she would sing. As she did, fish circled around to hear her. \u00a0For the Little Mermaid\u2019s voice was the most beautiful one under the sea. ",

High above was a deep blue sky with puffy white clouds. \u00a0Later the sun set, she said, and the whole sky turned gold and red.

He was working hard to keep the ship afloat. \u00a0He was throwing ropes out to his men who had jumped. But then, all at once, the waves got very high and the ship started to tip over.\u00a0 The Prince was flung to the side of the ship and thrown overboard! Down into the sea he fell.",

She dove deep and fast. \u00a0She reached out and was able to grab his shirt. Then she swam up to the surface as fast as she could. \u00a0At last she could pull his head above the water. There the two of them floated as the waves rose and fell. \u00a0By morning, the storm had passed. Yet the prince was as still as he had been all night.

With the scepter in her hand, the Sea Witch would rule the underworld kingdom! \u00a0The Sea King took a deep breath. What else could he do? So, he agreed.",

The Little Mermaid saw the Sea Witch rise out of the sea.\u00a0 She saw that with the scepter, the Sea Witch had become a huge sea monster. Tentacles were twisting out from all over her body like an octopus. \u00a0The Little Mermaid knew she must protect the prince and even his new bride. So she took out the knife. Just then, one of the Sea Witches tentacles reached out and lifted the Little Mermaid right off the ship! \u00a0\u201cThis is the end for you!\u201d crowed the Sea Witch.",

He learned the trails his mother followed were made by the deer. Bugs and critters, sounds and smells. So many wonders to explore!",

Then- here! \u00a0Bambi would wait.\u00a0 At last, when she said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u00a0 There\u2019s no danger. We can go,\u201d then the two of them would start on the trail again.\u00a0 But he did not know why they had to do this.\u00a0",

Wait till I call for you.\u00a0 But if I start to run, you must turn around and run back into the woods very fast.\u00a0 Do not stop.\u00a0 Do you understand me?\u201d\u00a0",

Most animals quickly fled out of danger.\u00a0 But some were not as lucky.\u00a0 With the hunter\u2019s loud noise and great power, many animals were killed and one of them was Bambi\u2019s mother.",

Bang!\u00a0",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

Woof!\u201d \u00a0Suddenly a big hungry dog came tearing by, chasing the two ducks. \u00a0They quickly flew up in the air, and their feathers fell down on the ground. \u00a0The poor Ugly Duckling froze in fear. The dog sniffed and sniffed at the Ugly Duckling, then turned away. \u00a0\u201cI am too ugly even for the big hungry dog to want,\u201d said the Ugly Duckling with his head hung low.",

There, above him, were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen! \u00a0Their long white bodies and slender necks seemed to just glide through the sky. He watched until the very last bird had winged its way out of view. \u00a0",

      "He stayed at that lake all by himself, and time passed. \u00a0The leaves of the trees turned deep red and gold, and then the leaves fell to the ground. \u00a0Winter came, setting a blanket of white snow all over. The cold wind and the dark clouds made the Ugly Duckling feel even more sad. ",
      "\n",
      "He had to go into the cold, cold lake to fish, but it was getting harder to swim.\u00a0 The lake was turning to ice. One day, it was all he could do was to paddle the water to keep it from freezing around him, and trapping him in the lake.",

      "In a moment, two giant hands swept him up. \u00a0\u201cYou poor thing!\u201d said a farmer. He held the Ugly Duckling close to his thick wool jacket and took the bird to his home. \u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Never was a warm fireplace more welcome! \u00a0For the rest of the winter, the farmer cared for the Ugly Duckling. \u00a0Then spring came. Tips of green covered the trees. Short, bright flowers popped up from the ground. \u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\u201cIt is time for you to go to the lake to swim again, as you were born to do,\u201d said the farmer. \u00a0He took the duckling back to the lake where he had found him, and set him with care on the water.",

And so he chose the famous Merlin the Magician. \u00a0Merlin could see into the future. And he knew those good days were not going to last.",
      "\n",
      "King Uther and the Queen Guinevere had a child, a baby son. \u00a0At a castle party for the royal birth, Merlin the Magician took the King aside. \u00a0He said, \u201cSire, there is something you must know. Soon a great darkness will fall over this land. \u00a0Your child is in great danger. Let me take the baby far away. I will be sure he stays safe.\u201d",

That very night, Merlin swept into the castle and took the child. \u00a0The next morning, the royal nurse went into the nursery. Alas, an empty crib! In fear, the nurse, the nobles and servants looked everywhere. \u00a0But the baby was gone!",

Travelers on the roads were jumped and robbed. \u00a0The people of England lived in fear.",

His younger son Arthur had been adopted as a baby. \u00a0Years before, a stranger had come to Sir Ector with a baby. He asked if Sir Ector would raise the child. \u00a0The old knight took the baby in his arms, glad for a second child. He named the baby Arthur, and raised the child as his own. ",

Kay could not sit still for lessons and he stopped coming. \u00a0But Arthur listened with wide eyes. He learned everything. I bet you have guessed by now who that stranger was \u2013 none other than Merlin the Magician! \u00a0",

      "At the end of each day when Arthur finished his chores, that was time for the lessons. \u00a0Merlin would sit with Arthur for hours and teach him about the world. Arthur was a thin lad, not strong like his big brother Kay. \u00a0Merlin said not to worry about that. He said what mattered most was to have a heart that was big and strong. Merlin saw how the birds, foxes and deer followed Arthur. \u00a0He could see that the boy had a very big and strong heart.",

      "The next morning at dawn, people started to arrive at the market. \u00a0There in front of them was something most odd. A block of white marble stood in the middle of the town square. \u00a0Resting on the block was a giant stone the size of a very large rock. At the very top of the stone there was a golden sword handle and a few inches of the blade, shining in the sun. \u00a0Yet \u2013 this was most odd \u2013 the rest of the blade was buried deep into the stone.

      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d said a voice in the crowd. \u00a0The Duke of Cornwall, dressed in silks and ribbons, stepped up to the white marble block. \u00a0\u201cHear ye, hear ye!\u201d he said. \u201cI call for a tournament to be held, one month from today. Knights from anywhere and everywhere in England are invited to come. \u00a0There will be contests and prizes.

      "THERE WAS ONCE a very rich merchant who had three daughters; being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education. His daughters grew to be very beautiful, especially the youngest, who was called Beauty, a special name that made her sisters very jealous of her.",
      "\n",
      "The two eldest had a great deal of pride because they were rich. They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any but persons of quality. They went out every day to parties, balls, plays, concerts, and so forth, and they laughed at their youngest sister, because she spent the greatest part of her time in reading good books.",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",

      "Suddenly, all at once the merchant lost his whole fortune, accepting a small country house at a great distance from town, and told his children with tears in his eyes that they must go there and work for their living. The two eldest answered that they would never have to leave the town, for they had several prominent merchants who they were sure would be glad to have them, though they had no fortune. But the good ladies were mistaken, for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty. As they were not liked on account of their pride, everybody said; they do not deserve to be pitied, we are very glad to see their pride humbled, let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their dairy. But, added they, we are extremely concerned for Beauty, she is such a charming, sweet-tempered creature who speaks so kindly to poor people and has such a friendly, gracious nature.",
      "\n",
      "When they came to their country house, the merchant applied himself to farming and Beauty rose at four in the morning. Before the others stirred, she made haste to clean the house and prepare breakfast for the family. In the beginning she found it very difficult, for she had not been used to work as a servant, but in less than two months she grew stronger and healthier than ever. After she had done her work, she read, played on the harpsichord, or else sung while she spun yarn.",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, her two sisters did not know how to spend their time. They got up at ten and did nothing but saunter about the whole day, lamenting the loss of their fine clothes and acquaintance. \"Do but see our youngest sister,\" they snickered, one to the other, \"how well she's suited to a life of menial labor.\"",

      "The family had lived about a year in the country house when the merchant received a letter with an account that a ship he thought had been lost at sea, that held on board dozens of bolts of cloth and silks he had purchased, had in fact safely arrived. The family rejoiced in the turn of their fortune. When the two eldest daughters saw their father ready to set out, one begged of him to buy her a new necklace of gems, and the other a thick golden chain, but Beauty asked only for a rose.",
      "\n",
      "The good man set off on his journey. But when he came there, oh such problems there were over who properly owned the ship and the merchandise on board, and after a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose, he came back as poor as before, especially after he bought the fine new necklace and gold chain he promised to his two older daughters. Thinking he might come upon a rosebush to satisfy the wish of his youngest daughter, he led his horse deep into the woods. As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized he was hopelessly lost. What's more, with the rain and the snow he knew he might well starve to death with cold or hunger, or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then in an instant, looking through a long walk of trees, he saw a light at some distance. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a place lit with candles from top to bottom. ",

      "The merchant hastened to the place, but was greatly surprised at not meeting anyone in the outer courts. His horse followed him, and seeing a large stable open, went in, and finding both hay and oats, the poor beast, who was almost famished, fell to eating very heartily. The merchant tied him up to the manger and walked towards the house, where he saw no one. Entering into a large hall, he found a good fire and a table plentifully set out. As he was wet quite through with the rain and snow, he drew near the fire to dry himself. \"I hope,\" said he, \"the master of the house, or his servants will excuse the liberty I take; I suppose it will not be long before some of them appear.\"",

      "\n",
      "At last he was so hungry that he could stand it no longer, but took a leg of chicken and ate it in two mouthfuls, trembling all the while. After this he drank a few glasses of wine. Growing more courageous, he went out of the hall and crossed through several grand apartments with magnificent furniture, until he came into a chamber. In the chamber was an exceedingly good bed, and as he was very tired and it was past midnight, he concluded it was best to shut the door and go to sleep.",
      "\n",
      "It was ten the next morning before the merchant waked. As he was going to rise he was astonished to see a good suit of clothes laid out on the bed that would fit him perfectly. Certainly, said he, this palace belongs to some kind fairy, who has seen and pitied my distress. He then returned to the great hall where he had supped the night before, and found some chocolate ready made on a little table. \"Thank you, good Madam Fairy,\" said he aloud, \"for being so careful as to provide me a breakfast. I am extremely obliged to you for all your favors.\"",
      "\n",
      "The good man drank his chocolate and then went to look for his horse, but passing through an arbor of roses he remembered Beauty's request to him, and gathered a branch on which were several. Immediately he heard a great crash like thunder, and looking around he saw a huge monster - two tusks in his mouth and fiery red eyes surrounded by bristles and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back.",

      "\u00a0",

      "\"Mortal,\" roared the beast, \"who told you you might pluck my rose?\"",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, sir,\" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life, \"I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment, and then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Thieving is thieving,\" said the beast, \"whether it be a rose or a diamond; your life is forfeit.\"",
      "\n",
      "The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but him to support them. \"My lord,\" said he, \"I beseech you to forgive me, indeed I had no intention to offend in gathering a rose for one of my daughters, who desired me to bring her one.\"",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"You say you have daughters,\" replied the monster. \"I will forgive you, on one condition - that one of them come willingly and suffer for you. Swear that if any of your daughters refuses to die in your stead, you will return within three months and place yourself at my disposal.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the merchant swore. Taking his rose, he mounted his horse and rode home.",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he got into his house, his daughters came rushing round him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way. He gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the gold chain to his second daughter, and then he gave the rose to his youngest, and as he gave it he sighed.",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you, father,\" they all cried.",
      "\n",
      "But the youngest said, \"Why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me my rose?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Later I will tell you,\" said the merchant.",
      "\n",
      "So for several days they lived happily together, though the merchant wandered about gloomy and sad, and nothing his daughters could do would cheer him up till at last, pressed by his youngest daughter, he related his fatal adventure.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately the two eldest set up lamentable outcries, blaming poor Beauty, and said all manner of ill-natured things to her.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Beauty spoke: \"Since the monster will accept one of his daughter,\" said she, \"I will deliver myself up to all his fury, and I am very happy in thinking that my death will save my father's life, and be a proof of my tender love for him.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Beauty, I am charmed with your kind and generous offer,\" said the merchant, \"but I cannot let you do it. I am old and have not long to live, so can will lose only a few years, at the most.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed father,\" said Beauty, \"you shall not go to the palace without me, you cannot stop me from following you.\" Beauty insisted on setting out for the palace, and made the necessary preparations for herself, and her sisters were secretly delighted at the prospect of getting rid of her once and for all.",
      "\n",
      "So next day the merchant took Beauty behind him on his horse, as was the custom in those days, and rode off to the dwelling of the beast. When he got there and they alighted from his horse the doors of the house opened, and what do you think they saw there? Nothing.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up the steps and went through the hall into the dining room. ",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "There they saw a table spread with all manner of beautiful glasses and plates and dishes and napery, with plenty to eat upon it. So they waited and they waited, thinking that the owner of the house would appear, till at last the merchant said, \"Let's sit down and see what happens then.\" When they sat down, invisible hands passed them things to eat and to drink, and they ate and drank to their heart's content. And when they arose from the table it arose too and disappeared through the door as if it were being carried by invisible servants.",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the Beast filled the doorway. \"Is this your youngest daughter?\" he boomed.",
      "\n",
      "And when he had said that it was, the Beast said, \"Is she willing to stay here with me?\"",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked at Beauty who said, in a trembling voice, \"Yes, sir.\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, no harm shall befall you.\" With that he led the merchant down to his horse and said to him, \"Honest man, go your ways tomorrow morning, but never think of coming here again.\" Then the Beast returned to Beauty and said to her, \"This house with all that is therein is yours; if you desire anything, clap your hands and say the word and it shall be brought to you.\" And with that he made a sort of bow and went away.",
      "\n",
      "So Beauty lived on in the home of the Beast and was waited on by invisible servants and had whatever she liked to eat and to drink, but she soon got tired of the solitude. Next day, when the Beast came to her, though he looked so frightening, she had been so well treated that she had lost a great deal of her terror of him. So they spoke together about the garden and the house and her father's business and all manner of things, so that Beauty lost altogether her fear of the beast.",
      "\n",
      "\"Beauty,\" said the Beast, \"if my presence is troublesome, I will end our conversation and leavy you. For tell me, do not you think me very ugly?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true,\" said Beauty, \"for I cannot tell a lie, but I believe you are very good natured.\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" said the Beast, \"my heart is good, but still I am a monster.\"",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Among mankind,\" says Beauty, \"there are many that deserve that name more than you, and I prefer you, just as you are, to those, who, under a human form, hide a treacherous, corrupt, and ungrateful heart.\"",
      "\n",

At last, however, she said trembling, \"No, Beast.\" Immediately the poor monster sighed, and then hissed so frightfully that the whole palace echoed. But Beauty soon recovered her fright, for Beast said in a mournful voice, \"then farewell, Beauty,\" and left the room.",

      "Beauty spent the next three months very contentedly in the palace. Seeing the Beast often had so accustomed her to his deformity, that, far from dreading the time of his visit, she would often look on her watch to see when it would be nine, for the Beast never missed coming at that hour. There was only one thing that gave Beauty any concern, which was that every night, before she went to bed, the monster always asked her, if she would be his wife. One day she said to him, \"Beast, you make me very uneasy, I wish I could consent to marry you, but I am too sincere to make you believe that will ever happen; I shall always esteem you as a friend, please try to be satisfied with this.\"",

      "\"I give you my promise,\" said Beauty, \"to return in a week.\"",

      "When Beauty waked the next morning, she found herself at her father's house. She quickly dressed and came to the kitchen, where her father gave a loud shriek and thought he would die with joy to see his dear daughter again. He held her fast locked in his arms over a quarter of an hour. As soon as the first transports were over, the father shared with Beauty the good news - both her sisters were married.",

      "\n",
      "The eldest had married a gentleman, extremely handsome indeed, but so fond of his own person, that he was full of nothing but his own dear self, and neglected his wife. The second had married a man of wit, but he only made use of it to plague and torment everybody, and his wife most of all. Beauty's sisters sickened with envy, when they saw her dressed like a princess, and more beautiful than ever, nor could all her obliging affectionate behavior stifle their jealousy, which was ready to burst when she told them how happy she was. They went down into the garden to vent it in tears; and said one to the other, in what way is this little creature better than us, that she should be so much happier? \"Sister,\" said the oldest, \"a thought strikes my mind. She told us of the promise to stay only for one week. Let us try to keep her beyond the week. Perhaps the monster will be so enraged for breaking her word that he will devour her.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Right, sister,\" answered the other. They went back to the house and behaved so affectionately to their sister that poor Beauty wept for joy. When the week was expired, they cried and tore their hair, and seemed so sorry to part with her that she promised to stay a week longer.",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Beauty could not help feeling uneasy that she was likely causing pain for poor Beast, whom she sincerely loved, and really longed to see again. The tenth night she spent at her father's, she dreamed of the Beast in the palace garden, suffering, maybe even dying, for loneliness for her. Beauty was startled from her sleep, sat up straight in bed, and burst into tears. \"Am I not very wicked,\" said she, \"to act so unkindly to Beast, who has tried so hard to please me in everything? Is it his fault if he is so ugly? \u00a0He is kind and good, and that is more than enough. Why did I refuse to marry him? I would be happier with the monster than my sisters are with their husbands; it is neither wit, nor a fine face, in a husband, that makes a woman happy, but virtue, sweetness of temper, and thoughtfulness, and Beast has all these valuable qualifications. Having said this, Beauty rose, put her ring on the mirror, and then laid down again; scarce was she in bed before she fell asleep, and when she waked the next morning, she was overjoyed to find herself in the Beast's palace.",

      "She put on one of her richest suits, and waited for evening with the utmost impatience, at last the wished-for hour came, the clock struck nine, yet no Beast appeared. Beauty then feared she had been the cause of his death; she ran crying and wringing her hands all about the palace, like one in despair; after having sought for him everywhere, she remembered her dream and flew to the garden, where she had dreamed she saw him. There she found poor Beast stretched out, quite senseless, and, as she imagined, dead. She threw herself upon him and finding his heart beating still, she fetched some water from the canal and poured it on his head. Beast opened his eyes, and said to Beauty, \"You forgot your promise, and I was so afflicted for having lost you that I resolved to starve myself, but since I have the happiness of seeing you once more, I die satisfied.\"",

      "\n",
      "No sooner had she said this than the hide of the beast split in two and out came a most handsome young prince. The prince told her that he had been enchanted by a magician and could not recover his natural form until a maiden would, of her own free will, declare that she loved him.",
      "\n",

      "An old man living in Alaska was sad.\u00a0 All of his friends and family were long gone.\u00a0 He began to wonder if he should leave the village and start a new life somewhere else. \"If I lived someplace new, at least I won't be around all these memories anymore,\" he thought.\u00a0 But he also worried, \"If I paddle away to another village and the people there see that I'm alone, they may think that I had to run away from my home village because I was accused of some disgraceful thing.\" Instead, he thought that he would just go off and live in the forest by himself.",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The poor man was so sad, traveling alone in the woods, it actually occurred to him to go to the bears and just let the bears kill him. The bear village was by a large salmon creek, so he went over to the creek early in the morning until he found a bear trail, and he lay down across the end of it. He thought that when the bears came out along this trail they would find him, and that would be the end of him.",
      "\n",
      "By and by, as he lay there, he heard the bushes breaking.\u00a0 Then a large number of grizzly bears came along.\u00a0 The largest bear led the rest. Then the old man became scared. All of a sudden, he realized that he did not want to die at all, and certainly not by bears. So when the leading bear came up to him, the old man stood up.\u00a0 He announced: \"I have come to invite you to a feast.\"",
      "\n",
      "At that, the leading bear's fur stood straight up.\u00a0 The old man thought that he was surely done for, but he spoke again, saying, \"I have come to invite you to a feast, but if you are going to kill me, I am willing to die. I am alone. I have lost all of my family and my friends.\"",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he had said this the leading bear turned around and growled to the bears that were following. Then the group of them turned back the way they had come. After a while the man turned and walked toward his village very fast. He wondered if the biggest bear had told the bears behind him to go back and get ready because they were invited to a feast.",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, in case that's the way it is, I better get ready to make a feast,\" thought the old man.\u00a0 As soon as he got home, he started to clean up. He took away the old sand around the fireplace and replaced it with clean sand. Then he went for a load of fresh wood. When he told the other people in the village what he was doing and why, they were all very much scared.\u00a0 They said to him, \"What made you do such a thing? The grizzlies are our enemy.\u00a0 You do not want grizzly bears in your home.\" When he was back home, the man took off his shirt and painted his chest.\u00a0 He put stripes of red across his upper arm muscles, a red stripe over his heart, and another across the upper part of his chest.",
      "\n",
      "Very early in the morning, after he had thus prepared, he stood outside of the door looking for his bears. Finally he saw them at the mouth of the creek, led by the same big grizzly bear. When the other village people saw the bears, however, they were so terrified that they shut themselves in their houses. But the old man stood by his door to receive his guests. He brought them into the house and gave them seats, placing the chief in the middle at the rear of the house, and the rest around him.",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "First he served them large trays of cranberries preserved in grease. The large bear seemed to say something to his companions, and as soon as he began to eat, the rest started to eat, too. They watched him and did whatever he did. The host followed that up with a course of salmon, with sprinkles of clover weed and dandelion on top for garnish.\u00a0 Then a course of deer meat with pine nuts.\u00a0 For dessert, raspberries with honey.\u00a0 After they were through, the large bear seemed to talk to his host for a very long time. It was almost as if the leader bear was giving him a speech, for he would look up at the smoke hole every now and then and act as though he were talking. When he finished, he went over to his host and licked the paint from his arm and chest.\u00a0 And so each of the other bears, in turn, did the same. The old man felt as if they were licking his sorrow away.",
      "\n",
      "The day after all this happened, the smallest bear came back to the old man's hut in human form and spoke to the old man. He had been born a human being, he told the old man, but had been captured and adopted by the bears. This bear-man asked the old man if he had understood their chief, and he said, \"No.\"",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"He was telling you,\" the bear-man replied, \"that he is in the same condition as you. That he, too, is old and has lost all of his friends. He had heard of you before he saw you, he said. He told you to think of him when you are mourning for your lost ones, as he knows how that is, too.\"",
      "\n",
      "When the old man asked this bear-man why he had not told him that day, when the bears were at the feast, he replied that he was not allowed to turn into his human form and speak his native language while the bear chief was around.",
      "\n",
      "After this, whenever the people of the village gave a feast, they would always invite an enemy to the feast.\u00a0 And they would become friends, just as the old man had done with the chief of the bears.",

The other had a good brain and a kind heart, but was given to great anger. If he wished to do a thing, he did it, and no man could prevent; if any one tried to hinder him, he would show sudden and terrible rage.",

You can not expect to live long if you do that way. Every time one of the pupils says a thing you do not like, you are greatly enraged. There are a thousand in this school.

      "THIS STORY takes place in Rome, where a Greek slave named Androcles escaped from his master and fled into the forest. There he wandered for a long time until he was weary and well nigh spent with hunger and despair. Just then he heard a lion near him moaning and groaning and at times roaring terribly. Tired as he was, Androcles rose up and rushed away, as he thought, from the lion; but as he made his way through the bushes he stumbled over the root of a tree and fell down lamed. When he tried to get up, there he saw the lion coming towards him, limping on three feet and holding his forepaw in front of him.",
      "\n",
      "Androcles was in despair; he had no strength to rise and run away, and there was the lion coming upon him. But when the great beast came up to him instead of attacking him it kept on moaning and looking at him, he saw that the lion was holding out his right paw, it was covered with blood and much swollen. ",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Looking more closely at it, Androcles saw a great big thorn pressed into the paw, which was the cause of all the lion's trouble. Plucking up courage he seized hold of the thorn and drew it out of the lion's paw, who roared with pain when the thorn came out, but soon after found such relief from it that he fawned upon Androcles and showed, in every way that he knew, to whom he owed the relief. Instead of eating him up, he brought him a young deer that he had slain, and Androcles managed to make a meal from it. For some time the lion continued to bring the game he had killed to Androcles, who became quite fond of the huge beast.",
      "\n",
      "But one day a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles. As he could not explain what he was doing, they took him prisoner and brought him back to the town from which he had fled. Here his master soon found him and brought him before the authorities. Soon Androcles was condemned to death for fleeing from his master. Now it used to be the custom to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions in a huge circus, so that while the criminals were punished the public could enjoy the spectacle of a combat between them and the wild beasts.",
      "\n",
      "So Androcles was condemned to be thrown to the lions, and on the appointed day he was led forth into the Arena and left there alone with only a spear to protect him from the lion. The Emperor was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him, it fawned upon him and stroked him with its paw and made no attempt to do him any harm.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "It was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor, surprised at seeing such a strange behavior in so cruel a beast, summoned Androcles to him and asked him how it happened that this particular lion had lost all its cruelty of disposition. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing its gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn. Thereupon the Emperor pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free, while the lion was taken back into the forest and let loose to enjoy liberty once more.",

      "ONCE upon a time there was a king whose wife had died in childbirth, leaving behind a dear infant daughter, the Princess Anne. When the princess was nearly grown the king married again, this time to a woman who also had a daughter, and her name was Kate. The stepmother became the new queen, and her daughter became the Princess Kate.",

      "\n",
      "The new queen was driven to distraction because the king's daughter Anne was far prettier than her own daughter Princess Kate. She could not bear the thought that her own daughter Kate would always look pale and plain beside the beautiful Anne. But bother the two young princesses it did not, and they became fast friends and loved one another like real sisters. The queen, however, was not content and she cast about for a way to spoil Anne's beauty so her Kate would be the prettiest princess in the castle.",
      "\n",
      "To that end, she sought the advice of the henwife, an old woman who lived near the palace and was known to have magical powers.",
      "\n",
      "\"So you say young Anne is too pretty for her own good?\" cackled the henwife. \"That is a simple enough problem to fix. Send her to me in the morning.\"",
      "\n",
      "So early the next morning, the queen found Anne and said, \"Such a nice day! I do believe I'll walk myself to the henhouse for this morning's eggs. Anne, be a dear and join me.\"",
      "\n",
      "So Princess Anne took step beside her stepmother, the queen. When they arrived at the henwife's cottage, they knocked on the door.",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I oblige you?\" said the henwife, who knew very well why the queen had come.",
      "\n",
      "Said Anne, \"We've come for some new-laid eggs for breakfast. Have you any?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if the girl will just step over ",
      "there",
      ",\" said the henwife, motioning to Anne, \"and lift the lid off that pot, she'll see what she'll find inside.\" Anne lifted the lid off the pot, and at that moment a sheep's head jumped right on top of her own pretty head and would not come off! She pulled and pulled but try as she might, it would not budge.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The queen felt entirely satisfied and she returned home with poor Princess Anne trailing behind, her sheep's head bowed low.",
      "\n",
      "The servants at the palace were horrified at the terrible event that had befallen poor Princess Anne. And none was more horrified than the queen's own daughter, Princess Kate.",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, Anne!\" Kate moaned to her half-sister, \"whatever shall we do?\" She tried everything she could think of to get the sheep's head off, but it was firmly fixed onto Anne, like her own skin. \"How did this happen to you?\" she cried. But whenever poor Anne tried to tell Kate, nothing but \"Baa, baa!\" came from her mouth.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we can't let you be seen like this,\" Kate decided. She took a fine linen cloth and wrapped it around her sister's head. \"We must go and try to get help.\" Kate took her sister by the hand and they left the castle.",
      "\n",
      "They went on, and they went on and on and on, till at last they came to a castle. Kate knocked at the castle door and asked for a night's lodging for herself and her poor sick sister. The servant who answered the door said that that would be impossible, as this was the home of a king who had two sons, and the younger prince was sickening away to death, and no one could find out what ailed him, so they could not possibly entertain visitors that evening.",
      "\n",
      "Kate begged the servant, saying that she of all people understood how terrible that can be because her own dear sister was also quite sick. Besides, she and her sister were so very tired and so truly needed a place to spend the night. The servant sighed, and disappeared for a while. When he returned he said that Kate and her sister could indeed spend one night at the castle, but only on one condition. The servant explained that the curious thing about the illness of the young prince was that whoever watched him at night was never seen again. Now if Kate would agree to stay up with him and nurse him all night long, then she and her sister could stay the night. What was more, the king would give her a peck of silver. Kate quickly agreed.",
      "\n",
      "So Kate and her sister were led to the prince's sickroom, where they were both sumptuously fed and made comfortable for the evening. Soon Anne's sheep's head was nodding and had fallen asleep by the fire.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Till midnight all went well. As the midnight bells rang, however, the sick prince got up out of bed as if in a daze, dressed himself, and slipped downstairs. Kate was surprised to see him rise and move about. She followed him outside the castle and he didn't seem to notice her. The prince went into the stable where he saddled his horse, called his hound, and jumped into the saddle. Kate lightly leapt behind him on the horse. Away they rode and as they passed through the woods, Kate plucked nuts from the trees to have in the morning, and she filled her apron with them.",
      "\n",
      "When they came to a green hill, the prince drew bridle and spoke: \"Open, open, green hill, and let the young prince in\". Kate whispered, \"and his lady behind him.\"",
      "\n",
      "Immediately, a passage in the green hill opened. At the end of the passage, the prince entered a magnificent hall, brightly lit up. Many beautiful fairies surrounded the prince and led him off to dance. Meanwhile, Kate, without being noticed, watched the prince dance and dance and dance until he fell, exhausted, upon a couch. The fairies fanned him until he could rise, and dance again some more.",
      "\n",
      "At the first ray of dawn, the cock crowed, and the prince hastened to get back on his horse. Kate jumped up behind him and home they rode. By the time the morning sun rose, the servants entered the prince's room. Surprised indeed they were to discover Kate was still there! There sat the girl, sitting by the fire, cracking nuts. Kate said the prince had had a good night, and that she would gladly sit up with him again a second night, but for that she must have a peck of gold.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The second night passed in much the same way. The prince rose at midnight and rode away to the green hill and the fairy's ball, and Kate went with him, gathering nuts as they rode through the forest. This time, she did not watch the prince as closely, for she knew what he would do -- dance and dance all night long with the fairies. Instead, she watched a fairy baby play with a wand. Then, she overheard one of the fairies say, \"Three strokes of that wand would make Kate's sick sister as pretty as ever she was.\" So Kate rolled nuts to the fairy baby till the baby set down the wand in order to crawl after the nuts. Then Kate quickly picked up the wand and wrapped it in her apron. At cockcrow she and the prince rode home as before.",
      "\n",
      "When the castle servants came in the next morning, they again found Kate sitting at the fireside cracking nuts.",
      "\n",
      "\"You are still here -- again!\" they cried. Motioning to the Prince, asleep in his bed, they said, \"Hast the Prince had another good night?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, another good night,\" said she.",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the castle servants left, Kate removed the linen that covered her sister's sheep's head. With the fairy baby's wand, she touched her sister's head lightly three times. At once the nasty sheep's head fell off, and Anne was her own pretty self again. The two princesses were both delighted. And so were the castle attendants, who noted that the sick sister had been cured, and what's more, that she was remarkably lovely to look at besides. Plus the prince seemed no worse, and the young girl hadn't disappeared for two nights straight. So Kate was asked to stay yet a third night with the prince. She agreed, but only if she should marry the sick prince.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "All went on as on the first two nights. This time the fairy baby was playing with a basket of barley, and Kate heard one of the fairies say, \"Three sips of barley soup would make the sick prince as well as ever he was.\" So Kate rolled a few nuts she had gathered to the fairy baby, who left the basket of barley behind to chase after them. Then she reached into the basket and put a handful of barley into her apron.",
      "\n",
      "At cockcrow they set off again, but instead of cracking her nuts as she had done before, this time Kate boiled the barley and made a pot of barley soup. Soon there arose a very savory smell.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said the sick prince, \"I wish I had a sip of that barley soup.\" So Kate gave him a spoonful of the soup, and he rose up on his elbow. By and by he cried out again, \"Oh, if only I had but another sip of that soup!\" So Kate gave him another spoonful, and he sat up on his bed. Then he said again, \"Oh! for but a third spoonful of it!\" So Kate gave him a third spoonful, and he rose hale and strong, completely cured. Then the prince dressed himself, and sat down by the fire.",
      "\n",
      "When the castle servants came into the prince's room the next morning, they were astonished to find the prince sitting beside Kate, and the two of them chatting away and happily cracking nuts by the fire. Meanwhile the prince's brother had met Anne in the castle byways and he had fallen in love with her, as nearly everybody did. Soon it was agreed that the two of them, too, should be married. And so the two princesses married the two princes, and all of them lived happily ever after.",

      ".\u00a0 At midnight one night, Guleesh was leaning against a wall of the rath and looking up at the beautiful white moon.\u00a0 He thought with longing, \"Nothing happens here! If only I were in any other place in the world but here!\"",

      "Suddenly he heard a great noise coming toward him like the sound of many people running together.\u00a0 The sound rushed up in what looked like a huge whirlwind.",

So he leaped upon it.\u00a0 As soon as he was on the back of the horse, he saw clearly that all around the rath, beautiful horses were speeding along, each one ridden by a little fairy man.",

      "\"Not a bit,\" said Guleesh.",
      "\n",
      "\"You're in France,\" said he. \"The daughter of the king of France is to be married tonight. Princess Isabel is her name, and she is a treasure to be sure.\u00a0 We mean to see to it that she goes back with us! You must put the young girl up behind you on your horse, for it's not lawful for us to put her sitting behind ourselves. But you're flesh and blood, and she can take a good grip of you so she won't fall off the horse. Will you do what we're telling you to do, Guleesh?\"",

      "The fairy men got off their horses.\u00a0 One of them said a word that Guleesh did not understand. Then Guleesh found himself and his companions inside a palace. There was a great feast going on there, and the night was as bright as the day with all the lamps and candles that were lit inside. The musicians were at the two ends of the hall, and they were playing the sweetest music that ever a man's ear did hear. Youths and members of the court were dancing and turning, making fun and laughing.\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "Such a feast as that one had not been seen in France for twenty years.\u00a0 For the old king had no children alive but only the one daughter, and she was to be married to the son of another king that very night. Three days the feast was going on, and the third night she was to be married, and that was the night that Guleesh appeared.",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh and his companions were standing together at the head of the hall, where the girl stood waiting to be married. But nobody could see the fairy men, for they said a few words as they had come in that had made them all invisible.",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me which of them is Princess Isabel,\" said Guleesh.",
      "\n",
      "\"Who else could it be?\" said one little man. \"Don't you see that the princess is over there?\"",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh looked where the little man was pointing with his finger.\u00a0 There he saw a young woman adorned with all the fineries a princess could wear. But when he looked again, he saw that there was the trace of tears in her eyes.",
      "\n",
      "\"How can it be,\" said Guleesh, \"that there's grief on her?\u00a0 Everybody around her is full of merrymaking.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"She is grieved,\" said the little fairy man, \"for it's against her own will that she's marrying, and she has no love for the husband she is to marry. The king was going to give her to that prince three years ago when she was only fifteen, but she said she was too young. The king gave her a year's grace.\u00a0 When that year was up he gave her another year's grace, and then another.\u00a0 But a week or a day more he would not give her and she is eighteen years old tonight, and so now it is time for her to marry. ",
      "\n",
      "But indeed,\" said he, and he crooked his mouth in an evil way, \"she need not worry about marrying this prince.\u00a0 She will come home with us instead!\u00a0 She will be our bride, if WE have anything to say about it!\"",
      "\n",
      "When Guleesh heard that, he was heart-broken to think that the Princess Isabel would either have to marry a man she did not like or, what was worse, would end up with a nasty fairy man for a husband. He couldn't help but curse the ill-luck that brought him to be helping the very ones who intended to steal this young woman away from her home and father.",
      "\n",
      "He began to think what he could do to save her, but could think of nothing.",
      "\n",
      "Just then the prince she was to marry came up to Princess Isabel for a kiss, but she turned her head away from him. Still, the lad took her by the hand and drew her out to dance. They went around on the dance floor to near where Guleesh was standing, and he could plainly see tears glistening in her eyes.",
      "\n",
      "When the dancing was over, the old king, her father, came up and said that this was the right time for the wedding ceremony to take place.\u00a0 It was time for the prince to put the wedding-ring on his daughter's finger.",
      "\n",
      "Then one of the fairy men, who was invisible to all,\u00a0 stretched out his foot before the girl and she fell. Before she was able to rise again another one threw something that was in his hand upon her, and said a couple of magic words.\u00a0 At that moment, the maiden seemed to vanish. Nobody could see her, for his words had made her invisible.\u00a0 But seen by the fairy men she was, and one of them caught her and held her in place.",
      "\n",
      "O! It's there the pity was, and the trouble, and the crying, and the wonder, and the searching, when that lady disappeared from before their very eyes, and without their seeing what did it. Out through the door of the palace went Guleesh, the princess, and the fairy men without being stopped, for nobody saw them go.",
      "\n",
      "Every one of the fairy men called out, \"My horse, my bridle, my saddle!\"\u00a0 Guleesh called also, \"My horse, my bridle, my saddle!\" At that moment the horse was standing ready before him. \"Now jump up, Guleesh,\" said the little man, \"and put the lady behind you.\u00a0 We must be going.\u00a0 The morning is not far off from us now!\"",
      "\n",
      "So Guleesh took her and raised her up behind him.\u00a0 With a flick of the reins his horse, and the other horses with him, went in a full race until they came to the ocean.",
      "\n",
      "\"Hie over cap!\" said every last one of them.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\"Hie over cap!\" said Guleesh. With these words, each of the horses rose up, leaped over the sea, and came down on dry land back in Ireland, to be sure.",
      "\n",
      "They did not stop there, but raced to the place near Guleesh's house where the old rath fort stood. And when they came as far as the rath, Guleesh suddenly turned, took the young girl in his two arms, and leaped off the horse.",
      "\n",
      "The fairy men called out when they saw what Guleesh had done. \"Guleesh, you clown, you thief!\u00a0 That no good may happen to you! Why did you play such a trick on us?\"",
      "\n",
      "But they had no power at all to carry off the girl, after Guleesh had leaped off the horse with her.",
      "\n",
      "\"What good have we now out of our journey to France?\" called one fairy man.\u00a0 \"Never mind,\" said another.\u00a0 \"You'll pay us back another time for this!\"\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll have no good to get out of that young girl,\" said another fairy man as he passed over the princess.\u00a0 He uttered a few magic words and clapped his hands once.\u00a0 \"S",
      "he'll be without talk from now on,\" said he. \"What good will she be to you now?\"",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Guleesh could answer, he and the rest of the fairy men had disappeared from the rath and out of sight.",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh turned to Princess Isabel.\u00a0 He said, \"Thank goodness, they're gone. Would you not rather stay with me than with them?\"\u00a0 She turned her head and gave no answer. \"There's trouble and grief on her mind yet,\" thought Guleesh.\u00a0 This time he spoke more gently. \"I am afraid that you must spend this night in my father's house, lady.\u00a0 If there is anything that I can do for you, why you just tell me, and I'll be your servant.\"",
      "\n",
      "The princess remained silent.\u00a0 Her face was white, yet she stood tall.",
      "\n",
      "\"Lady,\" urged Guleesh, \"tell me what you would like me to do! I never belonged to that lot of fairy men who carried you away. I am the son of an honest farmer, and I went with them without knowing what they were planning to do. If I could send you back to your father this very moment, I'd do it.\"",
      "\n",
      "He looked into her face, and he saw her mouth moving as if she wanted to speak, but no words came out.",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I not hear you speaking to the king's son in the palace tonight?\" said Guleesh, \"Or has that nasty fairy man made you really without speech, when he spoke those words and clapped his hands?\"",
      "\n",
      "The girl raised her hand and laid her finger on her tongue to show him that she had lost her voice.\u00a0 Guleesh could not stand the sight of the young girl in such an unhappy plight.",
      "\n",
      "He began to wonder what he ought to do. He did not want to bring her home to his father's house.\u00a0 Despite her fine clothes, he knew very well that they would not believe that he had been to France and had brought back with him the daughter of the king. He feared they would tease the young lady, maybe even insult her.",
      "\n",
      "\"I know what I'll do,\" he said finally, \"I'll bring her to my grandmother's house.\" He turned to the princess and explained that his grandmother would take good care of her, but that if there was any other place she would rather go, he said he would bring her to it, if he could.",
      "\n",
      "She nodded her head to show him she was willing. They walked together to his grandmother's hut.\u00a0 The sun was just rising when they arrived at her door. Guleesh knocked on the door.\u00a0 As early as it was, the grandmother was already awake.",
      "\n",
      "\"Guleesh, Guleesh, aren't you the nice boy to visit me, but that you must be coming at this hour?\" The grandmother looked at the young girl in all her finery. \"Now what have you here? Who is this fine maiden, or how did you come by her?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not telling a word of lie, nor making a joke of you,\" said Guleesh, \"but she is the daughter of the king of France.\"",
      "\n",
      "Then Guleesh told the whole story to his grandmother, about how he had gone off in the night with the fairy men and how before he knew it they had kidnapped the daughter of the king of France.\u00a0 And how he had finally gotten her away from the nasty fairy men but then one of them had put a spell on her so she couldn't speak anymore.\u00a0 And now what to do? The grandmother was so much surprised that she could not help calling out at times, or clapping her hands together.",
      "\n",
      "When Guleesh said that he would be very thankful to his grandmother if she would just keep the girl for awhile, the kind old lady said she would be happy to do that for as long as Guleesh wanted.\u00a0 Though the grandmother nor Guleesh knew how long she would need to stay there, or how they would be able to send her back home again, if ever they could.",
      "\n",
      "They decided the grandmother would let on that the girl was the daughter of an old friend she had, who was coming on a visit from another county.\u00a0 The grandmother would tell everyone that the girl couldn't speak, and do her best to keep everyone away from her. Of course, they would change her clothes to the simple frocks worn in Guleesh's town. The princess showed by her eyes that it was a good idea, at least as good an idea as any of them could think of, for the time being.",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh went home.\u00a0 When his family asked where he had been all night, he said that he had fallen asleep outside by the rath.",
      "\n",
      "There was great wonderment on the grandmother's neighbors at the strange girl who came so suddenly to the old woman's house without anyone knowing where she was from, or what business she had there. Some of the people said that it was a great story, how all of a sudden Guleesh was forever visiting his grandmother's house.",
      "\n",
      "That was true, indeed.\u00a0 For as often as he could, Guleesh would steal away to his grandmother's house and have a talk with her guest. Since the maiden had no other means of talking, she carried on a sort of conversation between herself and him, by moving her hand and fingers, winking her eyes, opening and shutting her mouth, laughing or smiling, and a thousand other signs.\u00a0 It was not long until they understood each other very well.",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh was always thinking how he could get her back to her father.\u00a0 But he did not know what road to go, for he had never been out of his own country and the night he went there, they had flown through the air on the magic horses.\u00a0 His grandmother did not have any ideas, either.\u00a0 Nevertheless Guleesh wrote a number of letters to the king of France and gave them to traveling merchants who said they were headed across the sea, perhaps to France.\u00a0 But all letters went astray, and never a one came to the king's hand.",
      "\n",
      "So it went for many months.\u00a0 Guleesh and the princess were falling in love, more and more every day.\u00a0 The boy feared greatly at last, lest the king should indeed receive one of his letters after all, and then find out where his daughter really was, and order her back to France. Still, he continued to write letters headed to France, though he did so less and less often.",
      "\n",
      "So they passed the time for a year.\u00a0 One day, Guleesh was lying by himself on the grass, on the last day of the last month in autumn. Suddenly, he remembered that it had been a certain November night that he had been standing at the rath when the whirlwind had come, and the fairy men in the whirlwind. He said to himself, \"We will have that same November night again today! I'll stand by the rath tonight. maybe the fairy men will come again. I may see or hear something that could be useful to know, or could help me bring back the Princess' voice.\"",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh went to the old rath when the night was darkening, and waited there for midnight to arrive. The night was as calm as a lake is when there is not a breath of wind to move a wave on it.",
      "\n",
      "He stood there for an hour, for two hours, then three. He was thinking that the fairy men would not come that night and that he might as well return home, when he heard a sound far away from him, coming toward him.\u00a0 At once, he recognized what it was. At first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore, and then it was like the falling of a great waterfall, and at last it was like a loud storm in the tops of the trees, and then the whirlwind burst into the rath, and the fairy men were in it.",
      "\n",
      "It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath.\u00a0 But he came to himself on the spot, and listened carefully.",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely had they gathered around the rath that they all began shouting and screaming among themselves.\u00a0 Each one of them cried out, \"My horse, my bridle and saddle!\" But then another little man cried out, \"Guleesh! My boy, is it you again? How are you getting on with the princess? There's no use in you calling for your horse tonight. You won't play such a trick on us again!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't he a prime lad!\" said another fairy man. \"To take care of a woman all year who has never said as much to him as, 'How do you do?'\"",
      "\n",
      "\"The joke's on him,\" said the voice of a third man. \"He doesn't even know there's an herb growing up by his own door that if he were to boil and give it to her, she'd be well.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Forget about the lad,\" said another voice. \"Let's be on our way.\"",
      "\n",
      "And with that, they rose up into the air and out with them the way they came. Guleesh stood there for awhile, thinking in his own mind on all he saw and heard, and wondering if there was really an herb at his own door that could bring back speech to the king's daughter. \"It couldn't be,\" he thought, \"that they would tell it to me, if there was any truth in it.\u00a0 But maybe the fairy man wasn't watching himself when he let the word slip out of his mouth. I'll look as soon as the sun rises and see if there's any plant growing beside the house except the usual weeds.\"",
      "\n",
      "At daybreak, he got up.\u00a0 It was the first thing he did to go out and search well through the grass round about the house, trying to find any herb he did not recognize. And indeed, he was not long searching till he discovered a large strange herb growing up just by the edge of the house.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "He went over to it and observed it closely.\u00a0 He saw that there were seven little branches coming out of the stalk, and seven leaves growing on each little branch, and that there was a white sap in the leaves. \"It's very strange,\" said he to himself, \"that I never noticed this herb before. If there's any power in an herb at all, it would be in such a strange one as this.\"",
      "\n",
      "He drew out his knife, cut the plant, and carried it into his own house, stripped the leaves off and cut up the stalk. There came a thick, white juice out of it.",
      "\n",
      "He put the stalk and the leaves in a little pot and a little water in it, and laid it on the fire until the tea was boiling. Then he filled a cup with the juice. Just then, it came into his head that perhaps it was poison that was in it, and that the little people were only tempting him that he might drink the poison tea, or even put the girl to death without meaning to. He put down the cup, raised a couple of drops on the top of his finger, and put the drops to his mouth. The tea was not bitter and, indeed, had a sweet, agreeable taste. He grew bolder then, and drank a small swallow of it, and then as much again, till he had drunk half the cup. He fell asleep after that, and did not wake till the next morning.",
      "\n",
      "When dawn broke, he went over to his grandmother's house with the drink in his hand. He never felt himself so bold, strong, spirited and light, as he was that day.\u00a0 He was quite certain that it was the drink he drank that made him feel so hearty.",
      "\n",
      "When he came to the house, he found his grandmother and the young lady inside. They were wondering greatly why he had not visited them at all the day before.",
      "\n",
      "He told them all his news, and said that he was certain that there was great power in the herb, and that it would do the lady no harm, for he had tried it himself and only got good from it. Then Guleesh handed her the cup. The lady drank it, and then she fell back on her bed and a heavy sleep came upon her.",
      "\n",
      "Both Guleesh and his grandmother sat up the entire night with her, waiting till she should awaken, and they between hope and unhope, between expectation of saving her and the fear they may have hurt her instead.",
      "\n",
      "She slept for the entire next day.\u00a0 When the sun set, she awoke at last. She rubbed her eyes and looked like a person who did not know where she was.",
      "\n",
      "Both were in great anxiety waiting to see whether she would speak, or not speak. Guleesh finally said, \"Did you sleep well, Princess?\"",
      "\n",
      "And she answered, \"I slept, thank you.\"",
      "\n",
      "No sooner did Guleesh hear her talking than he put a shout of joy and ran over to her and fell on his two knees. \"Lady of my heart, speak again to me!\"",
      "\n",
      "The lady answered that she knew that it was he who had boiled the drink for her and gave it to her, that she was greatly obliged to him for all the kindnesses he had shown her since the day she first landed in Ireland, and that he should be certain that she never would forget it.",
      "\n",
      "Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight. The grandmother brought her food and she ate with a good appetite, and they were all merry and joyous.",
      "\n",
      "After that, Guleesh would visit her several times a day. He spent so much time at his grandmother's house they all agreed it was best if the two of them should marry.\u00a0 ",
      "So they married one another, and that was the fine wedding they had. ",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that one of the letters Guleesh had sent to the king had actually reached the king.\u00a0 He sent a messenger to Guleesh's county to locate his daughter. The messenger found her happily married and returned word of this event to the king. The king, who had been grieving ever since his daughter had so mysteriously disappeared, was delighted to find out that she was not only discovered alive and healthy, but was happily married as well. He immediately dispatched a grand, royal wedding gift along with his best wishes for her future happiness, and many promises to visit her frequently in the years ahead.",
      "\n",
      "Though you might search the wide world over, they say, you will never find another happier pair than Guleesh and his bride Isabel. ",

      "LIKE ALL OTHER maidens and lads, Janet grew up knowing that she must never enter the woods of Carterhaugh. The fairies that dwelt in the forest there were known by all for doing strange and evil mischief to visitors. But Janet's father, the earl, owned the land where the forest stood, \"and why shouldn't I go there if I want?\" she thought.",
      "\n",
      "So one day Janet wrapped her green mantle about her, left her grey castle and headed to the Carterhaugh woods. As she stepped into the trees, her nose caught a scent of roses and she followed the lovely aroma to a clearing that was surrounded by rose bushes. Plucking a single large red rose, she drew the bloom to her face and its powerful scent nearly made her faint. Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of her.",

      "\n",
      " Startled, Janet said, \"Who are you?\" Gathering her senses, she drew up her chin and said, \"My family owns the land of Carterhaugh, and some day",
      "\n",
      " \"My name is Thomalyn,\" said he. \"I guard the forest for the Fairy Queen. This is not a safe place for a maiden like you.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I can manage,\" said Janet, eyeing the elf. \"Though if you know so much about the forest, and if I would like to explore it, why not be my guide?\"",
      "\n",
      "He was taken aback for a moment, then smiled. \"Why not?\"",
      "\n",
      "So Thomalyn showed Janet the wonders inside the birch and pine forests - orange poppies as wide as one's hand, bluebells that covered the forest floor like a carpet. The next day Janet returned to Carterhaugh, and each day after that. All the hours she spent in pleasant conversation and forest discoveries with Thomalyn.",

      "One day, the elf was pale and quiet.",
      "\n",
      "\"What troubles you?\" said Janet, who was already more than fond of the elf man. \"Are you worried that you're an elf and I'm human? For know this - I care not a whit about that!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"My lady, of course you would say that. I'm afraid the worry on my mind is far more terrible.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What can it be?\"",
      "\n",
      "Thomalyn sat on a rock and motioned for Janet to do the same. \"It's time you knew the truth,\" he said. \"I was born a human like you, in fact when I was but more than a boy I became a knight. A few years ago I was hunting in these very woods when a drowsy wind overcame me, and I fell off my horse. The Queen of Fairies was waiting and took me to be her servant. Since then I've had to guard the woods of Carterhaugh every day and return to her fairy kingdom at night. But even a life trapped in a cursed enchantment would be better than what I found out this morning.\"",

      "\"What's that?\" said Janet.",
      "\n",
      "\"That every seven years on Samhain Eve, the fairies hold a ritual that allows them to keep their powers for the next seven years. They have a procession through the woods that ends at Miles Cross, and there they sacrifice a mortal to the spirits. Ah, my lady, I am to be the next sacrifice!\"",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today is October 31st,\" whispered Janet, \"and tonight is Samhain Eve!\"",

      "\n",
      "\"Aye, and it is the seventh year,\" said Tam Lin. \"I'm afraid we must say our goodbyes now.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it cannot be!\" Janet jumped up. \"There must be a way to break the spell!\"",
      "\n",
      "He paused. \"There is one way,\" Thomalyn said slowly, \"but it is so hard and so fraught with peril, that I dare say no more about it.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must! You must tell me everything!\"",
      "\n",
      "Thomalyn sighed. \"If you insist. There is one chance, and it happens only when the procession approaches the circle of stones at Miles Cross where the sacrifice takes place. Only then, for a brief time, are the powers of the Fairy Queen weakened. If you want to save my life, you must hide behind a tree at Miles Cross tonight and wait for the procession to come by. Let the first steed pass - that will be a black horse ridden by the Fairy Queen - and then let pass a brown. But run to the next horse, a milk-white steed, and pull the rider down. I will be the rider and when I fall, you must hold me fast.\"",

Yet if you can hold tight and not let me go, then no harm will come to you and I'll be mortal again forever. If you can do this, once the spell is broken, wrap me with your green mantle and cover me out of sight.\" He held his breath for a moment. \"My lady, that's the only way.\"",
      "\n",
      "Anxiously, they parted. That night, in a gloomy and dark eerie stillness in the air, Janet made her way to Miles Cross and there she hid behind a large oak tree. Just before midnight, she heard the tinkling of bridles and knew the fairies were on the move. From behind the tree, she watched the first black steed pass, a horse ridden by the proud Fairy Queen, then a brown. ",

      "That moment, in Janet's arms Thomalyn turned into a monstrous bear snarling at her and frothing at the mouth. The maiden turned her head from its hot, angry breath but held on with all her might. A moment later the bear became a scaly lizard, slippery and venomous, its red tongue flicking about her face. Then what seemed like a lifetime later, the lizard was an ice-cold snake dripping with slime. Green slime oozed down Janet's hair and back while the snake coiled around her, tightening its grip and choking her. Then in an instant, the snake became a red-hot cinder. ",

      "here was once a princess of England who was a most charming princess when she wanted to be, but as with many other young people, royal or not, she was someone who was quite sure of what she wanted and when she wanted it, and didn't mind saying so.\u00a0 There was one thing she knew, and that was she did not want to marry.\u00a0 Of course many suitors came to call but she refused them all, scorning each one for even trying to woo her.",
      "\n",
      "The strong energy and high spirits of the Princess were known far and wide.\u00a0 There was a prince of Denmark who became fascinated with her.\u00a0 He sent word to the English palace, asking the king of England for his daughter's hand in marriage. This is how that sort of royal match happened in those days - one would send word, like that.\u00a0 When the king told his daughter of this message, the princess answered she would rather earn her bread by spinning all her life than to marry such a poor and miserable prince as the prince of Denmark.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "However, the young prince was determined to win her. He dispatched messengers with letters, and sent with the letters a gift of six beautiful horses, white as milk, with pink muzzles, golden shoes, and scarlet saddles.\u00a0 Such fine horses as these had never before been seen in England. The king was much impressed.\u00a0 He said to his daughter that a prince who could send such a fine gift must at least be considered for a suitor.",
      "\n",
      "\"What part do you not understand, Father?\" she said, annonyed Only a princess can in such a manner to a king.\u00a0 \"Father, I told you a million times I have no wish to marry - not to this fellow, nor anyone!\"\u00a0 So that her message was entirely clear, the princess ordered the grooms to cut off the manes and tails of the six horses, to soil them with dirt, and to return them to Denmark with the message that rather than be married to him she would sit in the streets and sell pottery.",
      "\n",
      "When he learned of this response, the King of Denmark became enraged.\u00a0 He declared that he would put to sea with all his ships and go to war with England at once to avenge the insult. His son begged him, however, to hold off on any such action.",
      "\n",
      "Instead, the prince built a ship, a ship so beautiful and costly that its like had never been seen before. The prince gave the sailors a letter to deliver to the king of England, asking his daughter to accept him in marriage, and to receive the fabulous ship as an engagement gift.",
      "\n",
      "The ship commanded considerable attention in England, no one having seen such a magnificent vessel before.\u00a0 The King was more impressed than ever and begged his daughter to accept the proposal without delay. A suitor so wealthy and generous, so true and devoted as this prince, he urged her, certainly deserved a favorable answer.",
      "\n",
      "But that night the Princess gave orders for the magnificent ship to be sunk to the bottom of the ocean.\u00a0 In the morning, she told the sailors to find their way as best they could back to their home country.\u00a0 She would rather wash cups and plates than to marry, and certainly not this poor excuse of a prince from Denmark.",
      "\n",
      "Upon hearing about the fate of his ship and the disdainful answer of the princess, the King of Denmark was more enraged than ever.\u00a0 He determined to man his fleet and take a bloody revenge. The prince prevailed on him one last time, however, vowing solemnly that he could turn the tide.",
      "\n",
      "And so the prince left Denmark quite alone and reached England. Since no one knew who he really was, he decided to call himself Greyfoot. Disguised in an old hat, dingy clothes, and gray wooden shoes, he arrived at the English palace towards evening.\u00a0 He found a herdsman and asked for work. That night the prince slept with the cows in the stable. The next morning the prince -- now Greyfoot -- began work as a herdsman's helper by driving the royal cattle to their watering-hole, and returning them safely back to the royal barn at the end of the day.",
      "\n",
      "The path to the watering-hole happened to travel exactly below the windows occupied by the princess. As Greyfoot approached below the princess' window, he pulled from a bundle he had brought with him a golden spindle, a rod used in spinning wool, and proceeded to use it in driving forth the cows. The princess caught a glimpse of the sun shining on the golden spindle. She took a great fancy to it, and sent someone down to ask whether the beggar were willing to sell it. Greyfoot answered to her servant that he did not care to sell it for money. However, he said that would gladly give it to her if she would only answer a single question he would put before her. ",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" the princess declared to her servant.\u00a0 \"Tell that herdsman a princess is not obliged to answer any question put before her by anyone at all.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" answered Greyfoot to the servant when he heard her response. \"Then let Her Majesty know that I shall keep my spindle.\"",
      "\n",
      "Yet she yearned for that beautiful golden spindle. And so she agreed to the terms.\u00a0 What was one question, after all?",
      "\n",
      "\"Princess,\" said Greyfoot, looking up at the Princess as she leaned out the window sill.\u00a0 \"Answer me this: Is the sky blue?\"",
      "\n",
      "The Princess laughed.\u00a0 Why kind of question was this?\u00a0 She answered with glee, \"Yes, of course yes!\" And the beggar gave her servant his golden spindle to take up to her mistress.",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the Princess noticed Greyfoot chasing the cows with a golden reel, a spool that turns as a spinning handle is turned. At once she sent one of her maids down to ask whether the golden reel could be bought.",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" was the message that Greyfoot relayed to the Princess through her maid, \"and the price is the same as yesterday. The princess must answer a single question that I put before her.\"",
      "\n",
      "When she heard this, the princess laughed to herself, remembering the silly question this run-down fellow had asked the day before. But as the treasure could be had in no other way, she agreed.",
      "\n",
      "\"Then here it is, Princess,\" said the beggar, looking up to the Princess at her window. \"Tell me this: Is the grass green?\"",
      "\n",
      "Again, the Princess laughed. \"Yes, of course yes!\" she cried. And so she got the golden reel, too.",
      "\n",
      "The third morning Greyfoot drove the cattle to the watering-hole using a weaver's shuttle of pure gold. The princess sent for him.\u00a0 When he appeared before her, she asked his name and he told her.\u00a0 \"Very well, Greyfoot,\" said she. \"How much do you ask for THIS\u00a0treasure of yours? Another mind-stumping question, I suppose?\"",
      "\n",
      "And Greyfoot answered, \"Your Highness, all I ask is that your answer be the same as it was twice before; that you agree to say, 'Yes,of course yes!' to the question I will put before you.\"",
      "\n",
      "The princess chuckled. Perhaps I'll be asked this time whether birds fly, or if fish swim, she thought.",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then Princess,\" said the beggar. \"Are you ready?\" She smirked. ",
      "\n",
      "\"Then here is the question,\" said Greyfoot.\u00a0 \"Will you marry me?\"",
      "\n",
      "The Princess was astonished. \"Surely you can't expect ME, the Princess of all England, to throw my life away on a shabby beggar such as you!\"",
      "\n",
      "The King overheard his daughter's cries. When he heard the entire situation he thundered, \"Daughter, I cannot believe that you gave your word to marry this man!\u00a0 But apprently you have, and so marry him you must. There is nothing more to discuss. The two of you, be off!\"",
      "\n",
      "The King made hasty arrangements for a wedding.\u00a0 Shortly afterward Greyfoot and the Princess were married. Thus the Princess was forced to leave her life of royal comforts.",
      "\n",
      "When they passed the barn door, Greyfoot turned to the Princess, saying, \"You cannot walk on these dusty roads in your silk gown and satin shoes.\u00a0 You must change your clothes before we depart.\" ",
      "\n",
      "\"Can this get any worse?\" wailed the Princess.\u00a0 But they visited the herdsman's wife, who gave the Princess - who was now Greyfoot's wife - a plain dress of linsey-woolsey, a woolen jacket, a cape, and a pair of heavy shoes.",
      "\n",
      "\"That's better,\" said Greyfoot.",
      "\n",
      "At first they walked on opposite sides of the road, without speaking. But after awhile the Princess raised her eyes to look at the man who was now her husband. To her astonishment she noticed that he was neither old nor ugly, but really a handsome young man, in spite of his old and tattered clothes. ",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet he tricked me, and I like it not!\" she reminded herself.\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "The Princess was not used to walking very far, and especially with such heavy shoes.\u00a0 She was soon exhausted. \"Greyfoot!\" she said, \"slow down.\u00a0 Do not walk so fast!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" he said, \"it is not easy having a princess for a wife. Very well then, I'll slow down, but move on we must.\"",
      "\n",
      "At last they arrived at a seaport. There Greyfoot obtained passage for himself and his wife as servants aboard a ship.\u00a0 The Princess felt much relieved when at last the shoreline of her father's land vanished from sight.\u00a0 \"At least no one I know will see me anymore in this state,\" she said glumly.\u00a0 She had no idea where they were bound, nor did she care.",
      "\n",
      "The voyage ended in Denmark. When they had safely landed, Greyfoot proceeded to rent a small cabin in the neighborhood of the royal palace. It had only one little room with a stone floor and an open fireplace.\u00a0 They both had work to do.\u00a0 He would earn money where he could, and she must prepare their meals.",
      "\n",
      "\"And to think,\" she said, sighing and looking about the dark, damp cabin with spider's webs in all the corners, \"that I could have married the Prince of Denmark.\"",
      "\n",
      "Greyfoot, who as you know was really the Prince of Denmark, said only as gently as he could, \"It's no use thinking of such things. You might as well get used to what we can afford.\u00a0 We need to make do as best we can.\"",
      "\n",
      "In a little while, Greyfoot went out and returned with an old spinning wheel and a bundle of rough flax, to be spun into yarn. \"I will go out to find work to earn some money,\" he said. \"But neither of us can afford to be idle. Spin this flax into yarn, and we might make a few pennies from your efforts.\"",
      "\n",
      "Greyfoot went to the palace at Denmark, his own palace.\u00a0 No one recognized him in his old clothes, and he found work there as a woodcutter. The Princess knew how to spin flax though she hadn't done it much.\u00a0 She spent most the day spinning until her fingertips were raw and her knees shaked under her.\u00a0 The yarn was forever becoming torn and knotted. Every evening when Greyfoot returned and examined her work, he sighed. They would not earn even a few pennies with this.\u00a0 Then he shared with her a loaf of bread and a jug of milk he had bought on the way home with the little money he had earned selling firewood. And they went to bed on their hard cots.",
      "\n",
      "One evening Greyfoot showed his wife a wheelbarrow filled with pottery.",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's a chance for you to be useful,\" he said. \"I had to use our savings for a deposit, and I had borrow the pots on credit, but it will be worth it when you sell them all by the end of the day. It's easy enough work to stand behind a table at the marketplace and sell pots, even for a princess.\"",
      "\n",
      "The next day Greyfoot went to his work as usual, and his wife set out for the town with her pottery. But just when she had managed to sell a few pots and was feeling good about the money she might finally earn, a troop of knights came galloping down the street. One of the horses got wild and rushed against her table.\u00a0 The pots fell and shattered in a thousand pieces under the heavy hoofs which trampled upon them. The riders went on their way, but the poor Princess could do nothing but clean up the mess and return to her cabin. Collapsing on a chair, she bemoaned her loss.",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, when Greyfoot returned, she told him of her terrible day. \"Now our situation is worse than ever,\" said he, shaking his head, \"for I have no money to pay for the pottery that's been broken.\" So they could do nothing but share their daily dinner of bread and milk, and go to bed early.",
      "\n",
      "Greyfoot came home the next evening with some exciting news.\u00a0 \"I found a good job for you at the palace,\" he said.\u00a0 \"They are preparing for a wedding, and tomorrow you are to help out in the kitchen. Do your best and make yourself useful. Maybe they will keep you and pay you good wages. Tomorrow they will give you your meals and twenty pennies besides.\"",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, Greyfoot said to his wife, \"Today I must stay at home. I feel a sickness coming on me. I will rest and try to get better.\" She became alarmed and said if he was ill she would not think of leaving him. He answered however that she was expected at the palace and must go.\u00a0 So she kissed him good-bye, hoping he would soon feel better, and promised to return as quickly as she could.",
      "\n",
      "The Princess spent the whole day in the royal kitchen. At the end of the day, to her fright, she slipped and spilled a great pot of stew on the floor. The head cook yelled at her loudly and fired her on the spot. Shamed and tearful, she returned to the cabin.\u00a0 Greyfoot seemed better but he could tell something was troubling her, and asked her what it might be. When she told him what had happened in the kitchen, her husband said not to worry. At least she had earned a few pennies for the day's work.\u00a0 And besides, since he was feeling better he had gone down to the road and heard some more exciting news. An order had been issued announcing that the Prince of Denmark was to be married to a Russian princess. The bridal-gown for the Russian bride was ready, but the Russian princess herself was delayed on the sea by wind and waves, and so was unable to be fitted for the wedding gown in time for the ceremony. The next day, every girl and woman was to present herself at the palace.\u00a0 Whoever matched the measurements of the Russian princess would be chosen to try them on for size and fit.",
      "\n",
      "\"To be fitted for a fine gown is surely a job you could do well,\" said Greyfoot. \"And who knows? Maybe your wages could pay off our debts.\"",
      "\n",
      "In the morning Greyfoot declared that the illness had come on again and this time worse than ever.\u00a0 Still, he would not keep her from going to the palace. She hesitated but as he insisted, she gave him a kiss on the cheek and left.",
      "\n",
      "The royal measurer was busy among the many women assembled in the courtyard.\u00a0 It seemed impossible to find anyone who fit the right measurements. But when at length he reached Greyfoot's wife, he declared that she was the very person they wanted.",
      "\n",
      "Now she was taken into the palace, and attired in a gorgeous wedding gown, a bridal veil, and a pair of exquisite slippers. When finally the crown was placed on her head, everyone declared that the REAL\u00a0princess could hardly be more charming than she. When the seamstresses were finished, the Princess started to take off the bridal finery, but the chief lady-in-waiting stopped her. \"We still need you to play the part for the rehearsal for the royal wedding,\" she said. \"The court must practice the event, and the bride will be very late arriving from Russia.\"",
      "\n",
      "In a little while, a beautiful carriage drawn by six milk-white horses was seen at the door. Greyfoot's wife was ushered to enter the carriage. The real Prince of Denmark was already seated in the carriage. Casting her eyes downward, the princess felt grateful that the Prince couldn't possibly know that the woman sitting beside him had once been the proud Princess of England who had scorned his many offers of marriage.",
      "\n",
      "They drove along the road until the carriage passed Greyfoot's cabin. All of a sudden she saw with alarm from a distance that the cottage was on fire.\u00a0 The woman in the carriage uttered a piercing shriek. She cried, \"Stop! Stop this carriage at once! My husband Greyfoot was ill at home when I left him this morning, and he may not have escaped from the fire!\" She tried to jump out, but only succeeded in tangling her long train and veil and dropping her crown. The Prince now spoke to her for the first time, and said, \"What? Are you talking about that woodcutter Greyfoot who has missed work these last couple of days?\u00a0 You would ruin the royal bridal finery for the likes of him? A fine young woman like you should leave such a tramp anyway.\"",
      "\n",
      "She answered hotly, \"He is my husband and always shares what he has with me, though I'm the one who's been of little use to him. Why, even if you offered me the place that I am now occupying as your real bride, I would refuse it, and return to the cabin where I have lived the happiest part of my life!\"",
      "\n",
      "The prince smiled.\u00a0 He said, \"But you are already my bride.\"",
      "\n",
      " Now she looked at him directly.\u00a0 Indeed he, the Prince of Denmark, and her husband Greyfoot were one and the same. Throwing her arms around him, she said that she was glad he was not burned up in the fire, and how could it be that he was really the Prince of Denmark?\u00a0",
      "\n",
      " And so they laughed and chuckled and said over and over how it's really something, how\u00a0 things can change with time and end up so differently from what may have thought, and so much the better for it.\u00a0 The Prince of Denmark and the Princess of England were wed again, this time for all to see.\u00a0 They were as content in the palace as they had become together in their humble cottage.\u00a0 And so the P",
      "rincess of England became the happy Princess of Denmark and in the years to come, its good queen.",

      "\n",
      "Flattered was she but alas! her heart was already offered to another. She sweetly smiled then her eyes flit about and off she was, leaving the lad feeling cast-adrift and sunk.",
      "\n",
      "Well, if there was one thing the lad was sure of, he could no longer walk about the people of that town. Not with everyone knowing she had passed him over for another lad, snickering and pointing at him as he went by. Nor could he fish anymore with the lads at the shore, for the shame of it.",

Every morning, very early, he sailed to the sea, laid his nets and hauled a day's catch. He took his catch to market at a port where no one knew his face, sold his fish, bought food and other necessities, and sailed home to his island. Such was his life, day after day.",
      "\n",
      "And so it would have stayed but one day, the corner of his eye caught something gleaming amidst the fish in his net. Quickly, he grabbed it by one hand, though it twisted and thrashed, and he tied the net into a knot so that whatever it was, was securely fastened.",
      "\n",
      "\"Release me!\" called a mermaid. To look at, she was just like any other girl up to the waist, but below that she flipped a long fishtail that glittered with shiny yellow-green scales.",

      "\"So it's a ",
      "trunk ",
      "of treasure you require?\" She reared her head with pride. \"I am the daughter of the king of the sea, and can have my mer-servants deliver such a trunk to your island.\"",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, she is not so different from the others,\" said the mermaid, but when the fisherlad tightened his hold on the netting, she quickly added, \"Of course I can grant your wish of love, but you must realize it will take some time. Release me and I'll give you a magic ring. After one year and a day, when you go to her and offer her the ring, she will not refuse.\"",

      "\n",
      "As he sailed back to his island one day not long after that, he saw what looked from a distance like a heap of seaweed. More curious it was when the seaweed moved, and as he sailed to shore, he saw that it was a wee brown-haired lass whose mangled dark hair lay in a heap around her.",

      "\n",
      "So they ate, saying little, but the next day they said a few words more, and the day after that, more still, until they got to know all about one another. He understood completely why she had to leave her house, and pounded the table with fury when she told him about her father and how he had been blind to the dangerous situation he put her in. She listened with sympathy to the tale of his bonny lass and how he planned to win her heart with the mermaid's ring after the 101 days. In fact, she posted a chart over the mantle to keep track of the days gone by and the ones left. A clever idea, he thought, since the scratches on the wood were becoming hard to tell apart.",

      "One morning she said, \"When you go to market, you must bring back a bit of window glass to keep the weather out.\" He obliged, and the next day while he was gone she placed the glass in the window holes. Indeed, the hut stayed warmer that evening. Another time she told him, \"Bring me back some whitewash - these walls are far too dreary.\" He complied, and she washed the walls and painted them white. Though he started to grumble about precious little money being left after he fetched her this or fetched her that, he had to admit that his hut was more comfortable than it had ever been before.",

      "Once a king made the unfortunate mistake of joking about the large nose of an enchantress who lived in the forest. Instantly the enchantress appeared before the King. Fixing her angry eyes on him and wagging her finger before his face, she said, \"There will come a time when you shall have a son. This child shall be born with an enormous nose,\u00a0 a nose even bigger than your big mouth, a nose that will remain stuck upon your son's face until the moment he realizes what an ridiculous nose he indeed has.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"If my son's nose is going to be as long as all that,\" the king thought to himself, \"he would always see it or feel it; at least, if he is not blind or without hands. Certainly by the time he walks and talks he'll realize he has an unusually large nose. At that moment it will be gone. This is not a matter for much concern.\"",
      "\n",
      "Soon the Queen had a little son, who was named Andre. Little Prince Andre had large blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas! his nose was so huge that it covered half his face. The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked; that it was a Roman nose, and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose. The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they told her, and when she looked at baby Andre again, his nose did not seem to her quite so large.",
      "\n",
      "The Prince was brought up with great care. As soon as he could speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses. No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own. The courtiers, to get into favor with the Queen, took to pulling their noses several times every day to make them grow longer. But, do what they would, their noses were nothing in comparison with the Prince's.",
      "\n",
      "When he grew older he learned history. Whenever any great prince or princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him that they had very long noses. His room was hung with pictures, all of people with large noses. The Prince grew up convinced that a long nose was a feature of great beauty.",
      "\n",
      "When his twentieth birthday was past, the Queen thought it was time that he married. She commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the others was a picture of the Princess Rosebud.",
      "\n",
      "Now Princess Rosebud was the daughter of a great king, and would some day possess several kingdoms herself, but Prince Andre had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort, he was so much struck with her presence in the portrait.\u00a0 The Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had however, a saucy little nose, which in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into a habit of laughing at little noses. Sometimes they found themselves laughing at her nose before they had time to think. This did not do at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully Princess Rosebud's tiny nose!",
      "\n",
      "The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they spoke, much less laughed. One courtier even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still, on a woman's face a smaller nose could be most attractive.",
      "\n",
      "The Prince made that courtier a splendid present as a reward for this good news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask Princess Rosebud's hand in marriage. The King, her father, gave his consent. Prince Andre, in his anxiety to see the Princess, traveled many miles to meet her. At last, when the moment had arrived for him to kiss her hand, to the horror of all who stood by, the enchantress appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning! Picking up Princess Rosebud, she whirled the princess out of sight!",
      "\nThe Prince declared that he would not return to his kingdom until he had found her again. Refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his horse and rode away.",
      "\n",
      "As the Prince journeyed from town to town, he thought all the people he passed must be mad, for all they talked about was the size of his nose. He couldn't understand why they thought his nose so big, and assumed they were jealous because they suffered with such terribly small noses. Thus passed several years.",
      "\n",
      "The enchantress had shut Princess Rosebud up in a palace of crystal, and had hidden this palace in a remote corner of the woods. Still, the Prince eventually stumbled upon that remote corner. One day, in the reflection of the crystal walls he caught the image of his bride, and felt joy extreme. The Prince set to work with all his might to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly. In despair, he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to Princess Rosebud. On her part, the Princess stretched out her hand through a crack in the crystal walls that he might kiss it. But turn which way he might, he never could raise her hand to his lips, for his long nose always prevented it. For the first time he realized how long his nose really was, and exclaimed:",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it must be admitted that my nose really is quite big!\"",
      "\n",
      "That instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters.",
      "\n",
      "\"Foolish prince!\" cried the angry enchantress. \"It took all these years for you to realize what a ridiculous nose sits on your face! You've been so anxious to believe yourself perfect, you've refused to believe anything at all to the contrary, no matter how many people tried to tell you the truth! Not till the moment your nose stood in the way of your own interests did you reckon with it at all!\" She laughed long and loud. \"You foolish humans never cease to amaze me!\" Then she vanished.",
      "\n",
      "The Prince's nose had now returned to a normal size, the size it would have been if not for the enchantress' spell before he was born. He and Princess Rosebud were married as quickly as a grand wedding could be arranged. And in the years that followed, the Prince listened with but one ear to the flatteries of court attendants and kept his other ear open for honest remarks. The Prince became known as a wise, thoughtful and admired King, and he ruled happily alongside his beloved wife, the Queen Rosebud.",

      "Once upon a time there was a man who had three sons called Peter, Paul, and Boots. The father was so poor he didn't even have one penny to rub against the other. So one day he told his sons they must go out into the world, for at home there was nothing to look forward to but starving to death.",
      "\n",
      "Now, the land was ruled by a king whose palace stood on top of a high\u00a0hill. A great oak tree had sprung up against the king's windows, and this oak tree was so wide and so tall that\u00a0 it blocked all the sunlight and so no light could come in through the palace windows. The king declared he would give a fortune to anyone who could chop down the oak, but no one could do it, for as soon as one chip of the oak's trunk flew off, two more grew back in its stead. Also, the King said he would give both money and treasures to whoever could dig a well in his palace-yard. Because the king's palace was on top of a high hill, and because the hill was made of solid rock, no well water could come up through the rock. The king was beside himself that everyone else in his kingdom lived near plenty of fresh well water, and he, of all people, was the only one who had to do without.",

      "\n",
      "The King set his heart on having these two things done, so he had it announced far and wide that whoever could fell the big oak in the king's courtyard and dig a well, should have half the kingdom. Well! as you can imagine there was many a man who came to try his luck; but all the chopping and hacking, and all the digging came to naught. The oak tree only got wider and taller at every stroke, and the bedrock didn't get any softer for well water to come through, either.",
      "\n",
      "So one day the three brothers decided to set off and try, too. The father was delighted, for even if they didn't get half the kingdom it might happen they might find a place somewhere with a good master, and that was surely more than what he could provide for them at home. So Peter, Paul and Boots said good-bye to their father and set off.",
      "\n",
      "They hadn't gone far before they came to a forest of fir trees. Along one side of the woods rose a steep hillside. As they walked, they heard something chopping and hacking away on the hillside among the trees.",

      "\"You think you're so clever,\" laughed his brothers, but Boots didn't care what they said. He climbed the steep hillside towards where the noise came, and when he reached the place, what do you think he saw? Why, an axe that stood there hacking and chopping, all by itself, at the trunk of a fir tree.",
      "\n",
      "\"Good day!\" said Boots. \"So you stand here all alone and chop, do you?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; here I've stood and chopped and hacked a long long time, waiting for you,\" said the Axe.",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, here I am at last,\" said Boots. He took the axe and tucked it under his belt. Then he hurried on to catch up with his brothers.",
      "\n",
      "When they had gone on a bit farther, they traveled beneath a steep rocky overhang.\u00a0 Up above the overhang they heard a noise that sounded like digging.",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder now,\" said Boots, \"what it is that would be digging and shoveling up yonder at the top of the rock.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"There you go again, with your idiotic wondering,\" laughed Peter and Paul again, \"as if you never heard a woodpecker before.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"This one sounds different,\" said Boots. \"I think I'll go see what it is for myself.\"",
      "\n",
      "And so off he set to climb the rock, while the others laughed and made fun of him. But he didn't let that bother him. Up he climbed, and when he got near the top, what do you think he saw? Why, a shovel that stood there digging all by itself.",
      "\n",
      "\"Good day!\" said Boots. \"So you stand here all alone, and dig and shovel!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's what I do,\" said the Shovel, \"and that's what I've done this many a long day, waiting for you.\"",

      "\n",
      "So they went on again a good bit, till they came to a brook. They were all thirsty, the three of them, after their long walk, and so they lay down beside the brook to have a drink.",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder where all this water comes from,\" said Boots.",
      "\n",
      "\"We wonder if you're right in the head,\" jeered Peter and Paul in one breath. \"If you're not mad already, you'll go mad soon. Where the brook comes from, indeed! The brook's here, that's all that matters. Who cares where it comes from?\"",
      "\n",

      "Following alongside the brook he went, as the laughter from his brothers faded behind him. As he went up and up, the brook got smaller and smaller. At last, farther on, what do you think he saw? Why, a great walnut, and out of that the water trickled.",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-day!\" said Boots again. \"So you lie here, and trickle and run down all alone?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" said the Walnut; \"and here have I trickled and run this many a long day, waiting for you.\"",
      "\n",

      "But his brothers had already gone ahead to the city. As everyone in the kingdom had heard how they might win half the realm if they could only chop down the big oak and dig the king's well, so many had come to try their luck that the oak was now twice as wide and twice as tall as it had been at first, for two chips grew for every one chopped out, as I daresay you remember.

      "So the King had now laid it down as a punishment that if anyone tried and couldn't chop down the oak, he should be sent in disgrace to a faraway island. By the time Boots had reached the city, his two brothers had already tried and failed.\u00a0 They had already climbed on board ship, in disgrace, headed to the faraway island.",
      "\n",
      "So now it was Boots' turn to try.",
      "\n",
      "\"If you are going to perform as well as your brothers,\" snapped the King, for he was angry that all the young men had tried and failed, \"you might as well save us all the trouble of watching you fail and go directly aboard ship to the island.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'd just like to try first,\" said Boots, and so he got permission. Then he took the axe out from under his belt.",
      "\n",
      "\"Chop away!\" said he to the axe, and away it chopped, making the chips fly. It wasn't long before down came the oak.",
      "\n",
      "When that was done, Boots reached for the shovel slung over his shoulder.",
      "\n",
      "\"Dig away!\" said he to the shovel. And so the shovel began to dig and dig till the earth and rock flew out in splinters. Soon he had the well dug out, as you may imagine.",
      "\n",
      "When he got the well as big and deep as he chose, Boots took out his walnut and laid it in one corner of the well. Then he pulled out the plug of moss.",
      "\n",
      "\"Trickle and run,\" said Boots. And so the nut trickled and ran, till the water gushed out of the hole in a stream, and in a short time fresh cool well water bubbled as high as a fountain, and the king had all the well water he could ever want.",
      "\n",
      "Well, since Boots was the one who chopped down the oak which shaded the king's palace, and since Boots was the one who dug a well in the palace-yard, so Boots was the one who was awarded half the kingdom as the King had promised.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Soon after he began his new duties at the palace, Boots talked the king into releasing all the prisoners held captive on the faraway island, since, after all, the tree was chopped down and the well water was flowing. The king reluctantly agreed. His two brothers Peter and Paul were glad to return to the mainland, though in later years they often wondered if they hadn't been better off back on the island, where they didn't have to listen all day long to everyone's saying, \"Well, that Boots sure was a clever fellow to wonder about things and go in search of the answers.\"",

      "ACROSS FROM A MOOR IN SCOTLAND there once lived a lad who earned his living as a beekeeper. Though he lived by himself in a cottage he wasn't at all lonely, maybe because he felt a connection with his bees. ",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "In warm weather when heather blooms covered the moor, the bees buzzed about with a satisfied kind of hum, sipping nectar wherever they liked, and he felt happy for them. In late fall when wildflowers became scarce, their buzzing became more erratic and he understood their anxiety. Sometimes the lad complimented his bees on an especially large batch of honey, and they seemed to buzz about in pleasure and pride. Folks in town said the lad could talk to the bees. ",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Of course that couldn't be true, but in a way he felt they knew each other very well.",
      "\n",
      "One evening as the lad was checking his beehives, two hounds suddenly appeared from across the moor, barking wildly, and dashing directly toward him. ",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The object of their chase soon became apparent when a white hare leapt out of the heather into his arms. Quickly the lad tucked the terrified animal under his jacket. ",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The two hounds circled his legs, barking angrily. He picked up a stick and swung it around; eventually the dogs gave up and bounded away. When the dogs disappeared from view, the lad set the hare back on the ground and returned to work. But instead of hopping into the thicket, the hare followed him, twitching its nose and eyeing him steadily.",
      "\n",
      "He went inside his cottage and the hare ambled in behind. \"Well now, you act like you want to be my pet,\" he said. \"It looks like you expect dinner. I suppose I might have a carrot for you.\" He let the hare nibble on a carrot while he scooped some stew into a bowl for his own dinner. When they had both finished, the hare jumped onto his lap and he stroked its head and ears. \"Ooch!\" he said with surprise. \"I've seen black or pink eyes on a white hare, but how did you get those blue eyes?\" The hare responded by stretching its back for more petting.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The next morning he took the hare to the hives to introduce her to his bees. He knew that changes in their environment can alarm bees, and he didn't want the presence of the hare to unsettle them. So he held out the hare for them to inspect her first, then set her down close to his feet. The bees dipped down and spun around her face but she didn't seem to mind. ",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "After they satisfied their curiosity and returned to their hive, he took the hare to the next beehive for another round of introductions.",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon a few weeks later, the lad noticed an old woman ambling along the track across the moor. Thinking he might sell her a fine comb of honey, he met her at the gate. Before he could speak, however, she pointed to the hare, who was peering out from behind a heather shrub.",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't see that every day,\" said she with a crooked smile. \"A blue-eyed hare.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" said the lad, turning to admire his pet.",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want for her?\" said the old woman.",
      "\n",
      "\"She's not for sale.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely you have your price, lad. Now look at this bonnie piece of gold. It's not every day you are offered a piece of gold for a common hare, now is it?\"",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"She's not common, and she's not for sale,\" frowned the beekeeper.",
      "\n",
      "At once the old woman, whom the lad had thought much too old for such friskiness, sprung over to grab her. A bee hovering nearby gave a loud shrill, a sound that surprised the old woman and apparently alerted the other bees. In moments a dark swarm had gathered and rushed to attack the old woman.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Eek!\" she cried, spinning around and running away. \"You'll be sorry you didn't hand over the worthless hare when you could have!\"",
      "\n",
      "The next day at the marketplace, when he was selling his honey, the beekeeper shared what had happened with the baker who tended the stall next to his.",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely the woman was a witch,\" said the baker, arranging his bread, potato scones and meat pies into neat rows. \"Take my word, you'd better be careful.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye,\" agreed the seller of sweaters and kilts on his other side. \"She's a witch, no doubt about it.\"",
      "\n",
      "But the lad thought, \"Then again, these two often think people are witches. \u00a0It could have been just a strange happenstance.\"",
      "\n",
      "Still, just in case, that night he barred his windows and locked his doors. From then on, he kept a close eye on his hare at all times.",
      "\n",
      "The summer passed. By the time frost lay on the ground in the morning, few flowers, and very few bees, remained out in the cold air. Most of the bees had already retreated to the hives where they began their cold weather work of keeping the hive warm enough for their queen to lay her eggs.",
      "\n",
      "One chilly October morning the lad was setting trays of sugar water inside the beehives when a gypsy caravan rolled by on its way southward. He waved to the driver and a young gypsy man waved back. ",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Much later, the lad noticed a sack of grain lying in the road just past the gate.",
      "\n",
      "\"Ooch, it must have dropped from the gypsy van! They'll never know it's missing till they set up camp tonight. \u00a0By then it'll be too dark to come back looking for it.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the lad hoisted the sack onto his cart and took off, following the tracks that the gypsy van had dug behind in the earth. In an hour or so he caught up with them. He hailed them. \u00a0When they stopped, he handed the young gypsy driver the sack of grain.",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to tell me you followed us all this way to return a sack of grain?,\" said the young gypsy man. \"Most folks are more than glad for us to go, and to never see us again.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Why shouldn't I bring it back to you?\" said he. ",
      "\n",
      "\"Else I'd have to think about your poor horses missing their dinner tonight.\"",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",

      "\"Yes,\" he said with pride. \"She's a special one, she is.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"More than special, I'd say,\" said the gypsy fellow. \"Grandma!\" he called inside the van. \"I want to show you something.\"",
      "\n",
      "An old woman with a bright headscarf, long pleated skirt and puffed white blouse stepped out of the van.",
      "\n",
      "\"Now what do you think of that?\" said the gypsy man, nodding toward the hare.",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh my!\" said the grandmother.",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only a hare,\" said the beekeeper.",
      "\n",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else could she be?\"",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Tis a lassie,\" said the grandmother. \"A lassie who's been bewitched!\"",
      "\n",
      "The beekeeper gasped. Then he spilled out his story. He told them both about the two dogs who chased the hare across his moor, the strange old woman who had tried to grab her, the bees who forced the witch away, and what his friends at the marketplace had said about the old woman.",
      "\n",
      "\"Your friends are right,\" said the grandmother firmly, \"That woman was a witch and no doubt the very one who bewitched the lassie. One thing you can count on, she will come back. She's biding her time for the lassie, that she is.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What is she waiting for?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"All Hallow's Eve, I suspect,\" said the grandmother. \"She knows the bees will be back in their hives by then. But most important to her, that's the one day of the year when the magic of witches is the strongest.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What can I do?\" he said, alarmed.",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, did you say you can talk to the bees?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Not exactly talk...\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Hmmm, however you talk to them, you may need their help. When you go home, explain to the bees that the witch may return.",
      "\n",
      "Before the sun sets on All Hallow's Eve, tie a good strong cord around the hare's neck and shoulders and keep her on your lap till past midnight.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"That sounds fine,\" said the lad.",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think this will be easy?\"said the grandmother. \"When she's under the witch's spell, she may pull and jump with a power that will shock you, but you must hold her tight. If the bees can help, all the better.\"",
      "\n",
      "The old woman took a deep breath and looked at him with her old watery eyes. \"That's all I can say. Other than that, what will be, will be.\"",
      "\n",
      "When the lad returned to his cottage, he carried the hare from hive to hive, repeating what the old gypsy woman had told him. On the one hand, he felt a bit silly explaining all of this to a mass of bees. Yet by their collective sounds they seemed to murmur in understanding, as a person would do who was listening. And when the lad stepped away he sensed a building excitement from within the hive.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "On All Hallow's Eve, the beekeeper tied a strong cord around the hare's neck and shoulders, and set her on his lap. There she stayed contentedly until the darkness settled so thickly that he could only see the profile of her white fur.",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly the hare lurched so powerfully that he could barely contain her. She twisted with such might it was all he could do to keep her from sliding out of his hands. Just as she started to wriggle free, he heard a hum that meant his bees were encircling them. Closer and thicker came the bees, forming a tall and deep surround. The hare jerked her ears and twitched her nose. She flitted on his lap and hopped about but no longer tried to escape.",
      "\n",
      "Finally the hare settled down once more. And then - the marvel of it! No longer was a white, blue-eyed hare on his lap, but a bonnie blue-eyed lassie! ",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Quickly he removed the cord from around her neck. They laughed at the wonder of it, they did not know what to think! But as morning dawned, the bees were back in their hives, the geese were winging over the moor, and the lad and his lassie were in the cottage, making plans to marry.",

      "\n",
      "Yuuki lived with his family in the village. His grandfather, who had passed away several years before, had taught Yuuki much about raising rice crops, solving disputes, and a great deal about the ways of the world. His grandfather had been the most respected and wealthiest resident of the village - its headman. Now Yuuki's family cultivated the enormous fields of rice that his grandfather had passed on to them.",

      "\n",
      "All of a sudden, Yuuki felt an earthquake beneath his feet. It was not strong enough to frighten anybody, but Yuuki, who had already felt dozens of shocks, thought it was odd - a long, slow, spongy motion.\u00a0 The houses below, by the sea, rocked gently several times, then all became still again. Soon after, Yuuki noticed something even more strange. The sea darkened all of a sudden and it seemed to be rushing backward, toward the horizon. The sea was actually running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide stretches of beach that had never been exposed before.",
      "\n",
      "With a gasp, Yuuki suddenly remembered the words of his grandfather. His grandfather had told the boy how his own father's father had told him that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. Yuuki, his breath heavy, ran down the mountainside to warn the people of the impending danger. Already many had run to the beach to witness the spectacular new stretch of ribbed sand.",

      "\n",
      "\"No, no! You don't understand!\" cried Yuuki. \"You must run away! Up to the mountain! Everybody!\"",
      "\n",

      "Desperate, Yuuki could think of only thing to do. He lit a pine torch and hurried with it to the fields. There hundreds of rice-stacks stood golden and dried in the sun. He touched the torch to the edge of each one - hurrying from one to the other as quickly as his legs could carry him. The sun-dried stalks instantly caught fire; the strengthening sea breeze blew the blaze forward. Soon the stacks burst into flame. Yuuki, terrified, ran after his friends and family calling, \"Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Quick!\"",
      "\n",
      "The people hurried from over the beach, like a swarming of ants, though to Yuuki's anxious eyes the moments seemed terribly long to him. All the while, the sea was fleeing even more quickly toward the horizon.",
      "\n",
      "The whole village was moving up the mountain now. The growing multitude, still knowing nothing, looked horrified at the flaming fields and at the destruction of their homes and their livelihood.",
      "\n",
      "\"Yuuki is mad!\" cried one of the boys when they had all reached the top. \"He set fire to the rice on purpose: I saw him do it!\"",
      "\n",

For that long thin line of darkness was the returning sea, towering like a cliff, and raging swiftly toward them.",
      "\n",
      "\"A tsunami!\" shrieked the people. Then all shrieks and all sounds and all power to hear sounds were annihilated by a nameless shock heavier than any thunder, as the colossal swell struck the shore with a weight that sent a shudder through the hills, and with a burst of foam like a blaze of sheet lightning. Then for an instant nothing could be seen but a storm of spray rushing up the slope like a cloud, and the people scattered back in panic from the mere menace of it. When they looked again, they saw a white horror of sea roaring over the place of their homes. It drew back, tearing out the land as it went. Twice, three times, five times the sea struck the land and ebbed, but each time with surges less strong. Then finally, the sea returned to its normal place and stayed there, though still raging, as the sea will do after a hurricane.",
      "\n",
      "On the mountain for a long time no word was spoken. All stared speechlessly at the desolation below, at the wreckage and debris that was scattered over what was left of their village.",

She wasn\u2019t allowed to have other girls over for tea. \u00a0Her stepmother said that little girls shouldn't have tea at all, much less eat bread and jam. All Natasha got for dinner was one small crust of bread, and she must leave the hut to eat it. ",

      "Next morning, the king and all the courtiers and servants were astonished to hear no more sounds of wailing coming from the dungeon. The king, suspecting something amiss, went down himself to see what had become of his captive. When he found the den empty, he flew into a great passion and fiercely demanded to know who had presumed to disobey his royal command.",
      "\n",
      "All the courtiers were so terrified at the sight of the king's anger that not one of them dared speak. However, the young prince, the king's son, stepped forward and confessed that the pitiful crying of the poor creature had so moved his heart that he himself was the one who had opened the door. When the king heard this, it was his turn to feel sorry, for he found himself compelled to put his own son to death or make a mockery of his royal proclamation.",
      "\n",
      "However, some of his old counselors, seeing how greatly the king was troubled, came and assured his Majesty that the proclamation would in reality be carried out if the prince, instead of being put to death, were simply banished.",
      "\n",
      "The king was very glad to find a way of getting out of the dilemma. So he ordered his son to leave the country and never to come back. At the same time he gave his son many letters of recommendation to the king of a very distant kingdom. He also directed one of the court servants to go with the young prince. Then the unhappy young prince and his servant started on their long journey.",
      "\n",
      "After traveling some time, the young prince became very thirsty. Seeing a well not far off, he went up to it to have a drink. However, there happened to be no bucket at the well, nor anything in which to draw water, though the well was full. Seeing this, the young prince said to his servant, \"Hold me by my ankles, and let me down into the well so that I may drink. Then I shall hold you by your ankles and you may drink.\" So saying, he bent over the well.\u00a0 The servant held his ankles and let him down as he was directed.",
      "\n",
      "When the prince had quenched his thirst and wished to be pulled back, the servant said, \"Well now, my good master, not so fast.\u00a0 I could let go of you right now and then what would happen?\u00a0 Why, you'd fall down the well and drown. Or, you could agree to change clothes and places with me.\u00a0 From now on I will be the prince and you will be my servant. Agree to this! Then I will pull you back up.\"",
      "\n",
      "The king's son, seeing that he had foolishly placed himself in the power of the servant, promised to do everything his servant asked, and begged only to be drawn up.",
      "\n",
      "The servant then drew him up, and they changed clothes. The wicked servant dressed himself in his master's fine clothes, mounted his master's horse, and rode forward on the journey, while the unfortunate prince, now disguised in his servant's humble clothes, walked beside him.",
      "\n",
      "In this way they went on.\u00a0 At last they came to the court of the king to which the exiled son had been recommended by his father.",
      "\n",
      "Faithful to his promise, the unfortunate prince had no choice but to watch as the false servant was received at court with great honors as the son of a king. Meanwhile he was sent to the waiting room with the servants and was treated by them with all familiarity as their equal in rank.",
      "\n",
      "After enjoying to his heart's content the luxuries and hospitalities the king lavished upon him, the false servant began to be afraid that his master's patience might soon be wearied all the indignities he needed to endure. For what if, he worried, one day the real prince were tempted to forget his promise and proclaim himself the true prince? Filled with these fears, the wicked man thought of all possible ways he could do away with his betrayed master once and for all, and without any danger to himself.",
      "\n",
      "Just then, he thought of a way to do this.",
      "\n",
      "Now you must know that the king at whose court this unhappy prince and the false servant were staying, kept in his gardens a great number of fierce wild animals fastened in large cages. One morning, as the pretend prince was walking in these gardens with the king, he said suddenly, \"Your Majesty has a large number of very fine beasts, and I admire them very much. I think, however, it is a pity that you have to spend so much money on their food. Why not release them from their cages, send them to the forest with a capable servant, and let the beasts find their own food in the daytime? Your servant will have only to bring them back by nightfall.\"",
      "\n",
      "The king asked, \"Do you really think, prince, that such a man exists who could bring back wild beasts after they were running free in the forest all day long?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" the imposter replied without hesitation. \"Such a man is now in your Majesty's court. I mean, of course, my own servant. Savage beasts are but pets to him, and he can easily control them to do his bidding. I dare say he may try to excuse himself and say the thing is impossible.\u00a0 But only threaten him that if he refuses to obey or fails to carry out your order, that he will lose his head. For my part, if he does disobey, I am willing enough that your Majesty should have him put to death, for he would certainly deserve that fate.\"",
      "\n",
      "When the king heard this, he summoned the disguised prince before him and said, \"I hear that you can do wonders: that you are able to drive savage beasts out like cattle to find their own food in the forest, and you can bring them back safely at night into their cages. Therefore, I order you this morning to drive all my bears into the forest.\u00a0 By tonight, you must bring them all back again. If you don't do this, your head will pay for it - so beware!\"",
      "\n",
      "The unlucky prince answered, \"I am not able to such a thing, so your Majesty may as well cut off my head right now.\"",
      "\n",
      "But the king would not listen to him, only saying, \"We will wait until evening and see how you do.\u00a0 Then I shall surely have your head cut off unless you bring all my bears back safely to their cages.\"",
      "\n",
      "Nothing the poor prince could say would change the king's order. The next morning the bears' cages were opened, the great beasts quickly lunged out, scattered into the forest, and disappeared among the trees.",
      "\n",
      "The prince followed them into the forest. He tried to follow the tracks of a few of the bears, but soon all of the tracks were lost in the leaves and he could not find even one. Finally, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, he sat down on a fallen tree. Thinking over his hard fortunes he wept bitterly, for he saw no other prospect before him than to lose his head that very night.",
      "\n",
      "As he sat in despair, a creature in form like a man, but covered all over with thick hair, came out of a neighboring thicket, and asked him why he was crying.\u00a0 The prince told him all that had happened, and as all the bears had run away he expected to be beheaded when he returned without them that night. Finishing his story, the prince examined the kindly, large creature before him.",
      "\n",
      "\"You resemble someone I met before,\" he said.",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said the creature. \"I am the wild man trapped by your father whom you set free from your father's dungeon.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"But you speak like a gentleman,\" said the prince in wonder, \"and besides, how did you ever find me here?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind that,\" said the wild man, \"You freed me, and I will free you.\" He gave the prince a little bell and said, \"When you wish the bears to return, just ring it gently, and they will all come back and follow you quietly into their cages.\" Having said this he went away.",
      "\n",
      "When the sun began to go down, the prince rang the little bell gently. To his great joy, all the bears came dancing awkwardly round him, and let him lead them back to the gardens, following him like a flock of sheep. Pleased with his success, he took out a flute and played a litte tune as he walked before them. And so he was able to fasten them up again into their dens without the least trouble.",
      "\n",
      "Everyone at court was astonished at this. The false servant was especially astonished, though he concealed his surprise. He said to the king, \"Your Majesty sees now that I told you the truth. I am quite sure the man can manage your wolves just as well as the bears, if you only threaten him as before.\"",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon, the next morning the king called the poor prince, and ordered him to lead out the wolves that day to find their own food in the forest and to bring them back to their cages by nightfall. \"Unless you do this,\" said his Majesty as before, \"you will surely lose your head.\"",
      "\n",
      "The prince pleaded vainly the impossibility of doing such a thing, but the king would not listen, saying only, \"I don't believe that for a second - I could see what you did with the bears.\u00a0 Besides, you may as well try.\u00a0 For whether you fail or simply refuse to obey me, you will certainly lose your head.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the prince was obliged to open the cages of the wolves.\u00a0 The moment he did this, each and every wolf sprang past him into the thickets just as the bears had done. He then followed the tracks but in vain, then he went and sat down to bewail his ill-luck.",
      "\n",
      "While he sat thus in misery, the wild man came out of the woods again and asked him, just as he had done the day before, why he was crying. The prince told him, and the creature gave him another little bell. He said, \"When you want the wolves to come back, just ring this bell, and they will all come and follow you.\" Having said this, he went back into the woods, and left the prince alone.",
      "\n",
      "Just before it grew dark, the prince rang his bell. To his great joy all the wolves came rushing up to him from all quarters of the forest, and followed him quietly back to the castle and into their cages.",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this, the false prince was flabbergasted. Acting as if he knew his servant could easily accomplish such impossible tasks all along, he advised the king to release the birds also, and to threaten his supposed servant with the loss of his head if he failed to bring the entire flock back in the morning.",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the next morning the king ordered the disguised prince to let out all the wild doves, and to bring them all safely to their cages before nightfall.",
      "\n",
      "The instant the poor young man opened the cage doors the doves rose like a cloud into the air, and vanished over the tops of the trees.",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely,\" thought the prince, \"this task is beyond hope>\u00a0 Even if I had a magic bell the doves will soon be far away and will never hear it.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the prince sat again on the fallen tree, and he could not help but bewail all his past misfortunes and present miserable fate.",
      "\n",
      "Hardly had he begun to lament, however, before the same wild man came forth from the bushes and asked what fresh trouble had befallen him. The prince told him his sad story. Thereupon the creature gave him a third bell, saying, \"When you wish the doves to return to their cages you have only to ring this little bell.\" And so it indeed happened, for the moment the prince began ringing softly, all the doves appeared from the sky and flocked around him. He walked back to the palace gardens and led them into their different cages without the least trouble.",
      "\n",
      "This time, a crowd had gathered to await the return of the amazing servant as word had spread of his wondrous talents. Leading the crowd in wait was the king himself.",
      "\n",
      "When the last of the doves was secured, the king stepped before the young man and thundered, \"Who are you, truly, that you are able to charm the wild beasts and the birds?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you, O King, have asked me for the truth, I have no choice but to oblige,\" said the prince. \"I will tell you everything.\" The prince then related how he had offended the king, his father, and been exiled for life, how his false servant had betrayed him, and how the wild man he had set free had come to help him out of the fearful traps the wicked servant had set for him.",
      "\n",
      "Hearing all this, the king was much amazed. Instantly, he ordered the exposed servant to be thrown into the dungeon. No one was more delighted at this turn of events than the king's daughter, who had secretly fallen in love not with the visiting prince, whom everyone had expected her to marry, but with his handsome, kind, and mysterious servant. ",
      "\n",
      "Soon the real prince returned her love, and more.\u00a0 The king gladly granted permission for the prince and his daughter to marry. For a wedding present, the prince asked the king to release all the beasts caged in the royal garden.",
      "\n",
      "The prince lived with the princess very happily for many years after this. When the king, his father-in-law, died, he left to them both the kingdom and all of its treasures.",

      "HE FARMER'S SON ",
      "LARS",
      "\u00a0was riding along the road with a happy heart. He and his horse would ride to the city, where he would buy a new jacket.\u00a0 That evening he was expected at his love's house at six o'clock to ask the big question, and he wanted to look his best. ",
      "\n",
      "Lars felt rather sure that Lisa, his love, would not turn him down.\u00a0 But her father was another matter.\u00a0 Lars was the sort of fellow who did not always arrive to places when he said he would.\u00a0 These were the days when fathers could say \"yea\" or \"nay\" on the matter of who their daughters married.\u00a0 Lars knew what was important to Lisa's father.\u00a0 And he was sure that as long as he got there by six o'clock that night, all would be well.",
      "\n",
      "To reach the city more quickly, Lars turned off the road and through a field to a long deep forest.\u00a0 As the woods opened to a green meadow, he suddenly saw something that seemed to be moving in a ditch. He drew nearer and realized it was a strange-looking woman, crawling along in the bottom of the ditch.",
      "\n",
      "She lifted her head and stared at him. He had never before seen anything as ugly and evil-looking as her face. Her small peppercorn eyes were almost hidden in matted dark hair. Her nose looked like a carrot, and her lips were as puckered as dark bread crust.",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you do me a good turn?\" she asked. \"I will reward you for your trouble.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" asked Lars.",
      "\n",
      "The woman said that she had hurt her leg walking in the forest.\u00a0 She continued limping along, she said, because there was a hill in the woods where seven pine trees grew. If she could reach those seven trees and gather a little resin from each one, the resin, if rubbed into her wound, would make the pain go away immediately. But then she had fallen in the ditch! And now her leg was worse than ever.\u00a0 And she was helpless. She badly needed someone to collect the resin from the seven pines for her. She would see that he was well rewarded for his trouble. ",
      "\n",
      "Since early morning, she told Lars, five people had accepted a gold coin from her for saying they would help, but they had probably enjoyed themselves with the money and taken another road home, because she had not seen yet any of them again. She held up a brightly shining gold coin before Lars.\u00a0 She said she would give it to him if he would fetch the resin.",
      "\n",
      "Lars stepped back. \"Who are you, appearing all of a sudden in the woods like this, and with so many gold coins?\u00a0 You must be a witch!\"",
      "\n",
      "She moaned and rubbed her leg. \"Oh, how it hurts! And my mother is walking in the forest right now looking for me, and calling for me. Listen, can you hear?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't hear anything,\" said Lars. But then the woman grabbed the mane of his horse, pulled herself up, and put her hand like a trumpet to his ear. Now he indeed heard someone singing, deep in the forest:",
      "\n",
      "Where are you, where are you, daughter of mine?",
      "\nI look for you everywhere -",
      " give me a sign!",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So why not give your mother a sign, so she can find you?\" said Lars.",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot!\u00a0 For I am too weak with this hurt leg,\" said the horrid-looking figure before him.\u00a0 She\u00a0",
      "sank rapidly back into the ditch. But she kept her head over the edge, and her small peppercorn eyes shot fiery glances.",
      "\n",
      "\"Laugh if you will, like all the rest,\" she hissed, \"and hate me! But I will give you money, as much as you want, if only you will get me that pine resin.\" And she rattled the gold coins in her fist.",
      "\n",
      "Lars stared at her.",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" he said. \"Now I know what you are.\u00a0 You are a troll.\u00a0 Keep your coins.\u00a0 I don't want to have anything to do with trolls.\" He cracked his whip and continued his journey.",
      "\n",
      "Lars rode into the city, bought himself a bright jacket, and turned homeward again. When he came to the hill that the woman had mentioned, he could not help looking around for seven pine trees. Indeed, seven pine trees stood in a row, leaning softly with the wind. At that moment he heard someone singing from far away:",
      "\n",
      "Where are you, where are you, daughter of mine?",
      "\nI look for you everywhere - give me a sign!",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up at the pine trunks to see if there really was any resin to be found. But it would be impossible to collect it anyway without going more closely to look, now that the afternoon light was fading.",
      "\n",
      "No, I must hurry, he thought, or I'll reach Lisa late, and that might cost me dearly, as I said I would be there at six.\u00a0 And so he rode on.",
      "\n",
      "Lars had gone only a little farther when his horse stopped by itself and pricked up its ears, listening. Once again Lars heard the song:",
      "\n",
      "Where are you, where are you, daughter of mine?",
      "\nI look for you everywhere - give me a sign!",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If only I had time to gather some of that resin, he thought, and turned his horse to move closer to the pine trees. But after a minute he changed his mind again. It's madness, he said to himself. What do I care about an ugly old troll woman? So he turned back to the road.",
      "\n",
      "It did not take long before the horse stopped again.\u00a0 Once more Lars he heard the song:",
      "\n",
      "Where are you, where are you, daughter of mine?",
      "\nI look for you everywhere - give me a sign!",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't bear it, he thought. If I don't get the resin, I'm afraid I will never stop hearing that song. And so he galloped back to the seven pine trees waving in the wind.",
      "\n",
      "He examined the trunks and branches, and did at least succeed in gathering resin from each one of those seven trees. By now it was almost dark, and he began to gallop along the road. \"Why did I bother with?\" he thought.\u00a0 \"She probably won't even be there when I get back to look for her, and look at all the time that I lost.\"\u00a0 He came to the ditch.\u00a0 The troll woman was still lying in there.",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, take it!\" he shouted at her, practically throwing the resin into her lap. \"And I hope I never see you again, for you have probably cost me my sweetheart's hand!\"",
      "\n",
      "He spurred his horse on without waiting to hear whether she would thank him or not, much less to collect his gold coin. He was angry and anxious, sure that he would now be too late. And for what?",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he heard the tramp of horses' hooves nearby.\u00a0 From around a bend in the road, a rider approached him. It was his brother. He looked a sight, and his horse was all in a lather.",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll be late, you'll be late!\" his brother Joseph called. For all knew about his appointment at Lisa's house tonight, at six.\u00a0 As the two of them galloped on together, it was a quarter to six and they still had several miles to go.",
      "\n",
      "\"Go!\" Lars called, urging his horse to the utmost and streaking along the forest path at breakneck speed. It was so dark he could hardly see the road before him. Branches tore at his handsome new jacket and scratched his forehead until it bled, but he paid no attention. All Lars could think of was disappointing Lisa, and losing her father's favor. That was what you got for having anything to do with trolls.",
      "\n",
      "Soon his horse began to pant and stumble and trip. Lars was afraid it might well collapse under him. The horse went slower and slower, no matter how much he urged it forward.",
      "\n",
      "Then he felt the reins stiffen and go taut in his hands. The horse lifted its head, and its hooves began to fly over the ground. Something seemed to have brought it back to life, and it went so fast that Lars' cape was billowing behind him.",
      "\n",
      "Lars turned round in the saddle. It seemed to him that someone was sitting behind him on the horses' back. But no one was there.\u00a0 Yet he imagined he saw what looked like a gray fuzzy shape behind him on the horse.",
      "\n",
      "The ride became wilder and wilder. Lars no longer felt in control of the reins at all.\u00a0 Now the horse no longer followed the road, but turned in among bushes and undergrowth. It jumped hillocks and streams.\u00a0 Every time Lars cast a look behind, he dimly glimpsed a gray bundle sliding farther back on the horse. And every time he looked ahead, he felt more and more sure that someone was sitting behind him.",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the open fields now, and his cape was flying straight up over his head, stretched as trim as a sail. The horse flew like a bird and its hooves barely touched ground. At the first fork in the road, Lars met his best friend Lucas, who had run out to find him and urge him to hurry.",
      "\n",
      "\"You will be too late, Lars!\" shouted Lucas. \"Only five minutes left.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll see,\" Lars called and was gone in a flash.",
      "\n",
      "A little further on he met his old father, who shook his head sadly. \"You will never get there. You have only a minute left.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll see,\" Lars called.\u00a0 He disappeared so fast that the old man did not even see him go.",
      "\n",
      "At the farmer's house, everyone was waiting. His love Lisa, her arm leaning on the window-sill, was listening for the beat of hooves, while her father frowned and tapped his feet impatiently.",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Lisa's father, looking at the clock on the wall. \"There is only half a minute left. If he were going to come on time, we would have heard his horse on the bridge by now. Lisa, there is no point in marrying someone who cannot be here at an appointed time to ask for your hand in marriage.\u00a0 If he cannot do this, he is not for you.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I will wait until six o'clock,\" Lisa said. She stood there with a beating heart. It would be desperately hard for her to lose Lars.",
      "\n",
      "The clock began to chime.",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too late!\" cried Lisa's father.",
      "\n",
      "The strong beat of hooves was heard on the bridge just then. Lisa's eyes shone with joy.",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen, he is coming!\" she exclaimed.",
      "\n",
      "\"Too late, though,\" said her father.",
      "\n",
      "But just as the clock was ready to chime for the sixth time, the door was flung open.\u00a0 There stood Lars dripping wet, his hair tousled, and his new jacket torn and dusty. Somehow he looked jaunty and dashing all the same, and Lisa ran to him.\u00a0 She put her hand in his, so firmly and confidently that he knew she was giving it to him for life.",
      "\n",
      "Her father could only gape. He could not understand how Lars had managed to arrive on time, and no one else understood it, either.",
      "\n",
      "But this was not the last time people would marvel at Lars. From then on, regardless of how late he set out on any journey, he would always arrive on time, and no one ever saw him anxious to get started. Whether he rode on horseback or in a carriage, he was calm and assured. And he could well afford to be, for he always felt he had someone with him, someone who held the bridle and reins in such a way that all his adventures always finished well. ",
      "\n",
      "But how this was he never could discover, no matter how many times he thought he glimpsed a gray fuzzy shape slip down behind him on his horse or off the edge of his carriage the moment he turned his head. Yet inside himself Lars knew who it was that sat behind him.",
      "\n",
      "He had not asked any reward for what he had done for the troll in the ditch.\u00a0 But for all that, it had been an honest troll, and a reward he certainly did receive from her.",

The Queen stopped her horses, lifted the child up in her arms, and kissed her on both cheeks. All the while she thought to herself, \"I do so love my sons, but oh! how I wish I had a little girl of my own!\"",
      "\n",
      "Just then an old witch of the trolls came up to her. She seemed every bit a good witch, gentle and kind.",

      "Now the Queen had a little snow-white dog of which she was very fond.\u00a0 It always ran to greet her when she had been away. She thought it must be the dog the old dame wanted. Since the old woman seemed gentle and kind, she would surely care well for the dog.\u00a0 So the Queen said, \"Yes, you may have what comes to meet me on the bridge if that is what will bring me a daughter.\" With that she hurried home as fast as she could.",
      "\n",
      "But who should come to meet her on the bridge, not her snow-white dog at all, but her twelve sons! Before the mother could cry out to them to stop, the witch of the trolls, who turned out to be a wicked witch after all, threw a spell upon them all and turned them into twelve ducks! The ducks flapped their wings, flew away, and away they stayed.",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it seems so dull and lonely here,\" said the daughter. \"Everyone else has brothers and sisters, but I am all alone. I have no one. \"",

      "After the Princess learned how her brothers had been lost, she could not rest nor sleep nor eat, for she seized on the notion that it was all her fault. She decided she must go in search of her lost brothers, and at once. She expressed to the Queen that she felt she must find\u00a0them and somehow free them of their terrible curse. ",
      "\n",
      "The Queen wept and begged her not to go, for the thought of losing her last child was almost too much for her to bear. Yet, in spite of all the Queen could say or do, the lass felt she could not could not remain comfortably at home while her brothers still suffered under enchantment, and all because of her! So she ventured from her comfortable life in the palace.",

      "She dreamed that she was walking deeper and deeper into the woods and then came to a little wooden hut, and within the hut she found her brothers. Just then she awoke. Straight before her she noticed a worn path in the green moss that she hadn't seen before. This path went deeper into the woods, and so she followed it. Astonished, she discovered at the end of the path a little hut exactly like the one she had seen in her dream.",

When she saw that, her heart leaped, for she could guess at once that it was her brothers who lived there. She began to build up the fire.",
      "\n",
      "Soon she heard something flapping and whirling in the air, and she slipped behind the door. Twelve ducks approached the doorway of the little house, but as soon as they crossed the threshold they become young men, each one dressed as a prince.",

But the entire time while you work on that, you must neither talk, nor laugh, nor weep. If you can do this, we will be set free!\"",

      "\"Where will I ever get enough thistledown for so many shirts?\" asked the sister.",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's the hardest part of all,\" said the youngest brother with a sigh. \"You must go to the witches' moor at midnight and gather it there.\" Big tears stood in his eyes. \"And you must go alone. All alone.\"",
      "\n",
      "The sister said nothing, and nodded her head. When midnight came and the moon was high in the sky, she kissed her brothers goodbye and went to the great, wide moor where the witches lived. A great crop of thistles stood there, all nodding in the breeze, while the thistledown atop the plant floated and glistened through the moonbeams. ",

      "The Princess began to pluck the thistledown and gather it in her bag. Soon she became aware of a host of wicked faces staring at her through the thistles.\u00a0 What was even more frightening, long skinny arms stretching out toward her. Her heart stood still and she grew icy cold, but never a sound did she utter. She just kept plucking and gathering, faster and faster, until her bag was full. When she got home at break of day, she set to work carding and spinning yarn from the soft down to make her cloth.",

      "So she went on for a long, long time, picking thistledown on the witches' moor, trying not to notice the wicked faces and the long, skinny arms, then taking it back to the hut, carding and spinning and making more cloth. All the while she was careful never to talk, nor to laugh, nor to weep.",
      "\n",
      "In the evening her brothers came home, flapping and whirring like wild ducks, yet becoming young men as they passed through the threshold. In the morning, the moment her brothers stepped outside the house, off they flew again and became wild ducks for the whole day.",
      "\n",
      "One night when the Princess was picking thistledown at the moor, the young King who ruled that land was out hunting. He had become separated from his companions and had lost his way. Now, as he came riding across the moor, he saw her. He stopped his horse and stared at her, wondering who the young lady could be who walked alone on the moor, picking thistledown in the dead of night. ",

But he was so charmed by her graceful movements and her dedication to the task at hand, that at last nothing would do but to ask to take her home to his castle.\u00a0 So he motioned to the horse.\u00a0 The princess wrung her hands and made signs to him and pointed to the bags in which her work was.\u00a0 And so the prince stayed with her while she worked, helping her as he could, until all her bags were stuffed full. The Princess saw that the King was as gentle and kind to her as a mother, and helpful, too.\u00a0 By the time the sun was rising, the King motioned to the horse, signaling to ask if she'd like to come back to the castle with him.\u00a0 She agreed gladly, and he helped her onto the horse. The King took the bags full of thistledown and gently tied them securely behind the horse, and so she rode the horse, with him beside her.",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they reached the palace, an old woman staggered forward to meet them. She was the King's guardian, and the moment she set eyes upon the charming young maiden, she was filled with jealousy and anger. Noticing that the maiden said nothing, the old woman ushered the King aside.\u00a0 She whispered, \"Can't you see that this thing whom you have brought home to marry is in fact a witch? Why, look at her! She can neither talk nor laugh nor weep!\"",

He knew, somehow, that she was just the woman he had been looking for.\u00a0 When she looked at him, he was sure that she felt the same way, too.\u00a0 It wasn't long before a grand wedding was held, the King married the Princess, and they lived in great joy and glory.",
      "\n",
      "The Princess did not forget to go on working on her shirts, and all this time she neither talked nor laughed nor wept. Though she was making very good progress, she found that she still had not enough cloth to finish all twelve shirts, and she needed to go back to the witches' moor one last time.",
      "\n",
      "That night, while all the palace slept, she quietly slipped out to pick her thistledown. Now the old woman who was the King's guardian saw her leave, and she knew well where the young Queen was going, for I must tell you that she was the same wicked witch who had changed the twelve Princes into wild ducks in the first place!\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "The witch hurried to the King's chamber.\u00a0 She shook him awake and said, \"Come with me! I'll prove to you that your new bride is a witch! She can't help but return to the witches' moor at midnight, where no doubt she'll join her wicked company.\" The King would not listen to her at first, but when he saw that the Queen's bed was empty, he got up and went with the old woman.",

      "\n",
      "The wicked old woman began to whisper and tell everyone at court about the Queen's nightly visit to the witches' moor. Finally the King's advisors clamored, \"We will not have a Queen who is a witch! Everyone knows the penalty for witchcraft!\u00a0 The people demand of you that she be burned alive!\"",
      "\n",
      "The King was beside himself.\u00a0 As King, he knew the laws of the land had to be upheld.\u00a0 But there was no end to his sadness, for now he despaired that he could not save his Queen. A pile of wood was gathered in the court square. When the pile was all ablaze, and the men were about to put the Queen on it, she made signs to them to take twelve boards and lay them around the pile. On these twelve boards she placed the shirts for her brothers, all completed except the one for the youngest, which still needed its left sleeve. She had not had time to finish it. As soon as she set the shirts on the boards, the people heard a flapping and whirring in the air, and down swooped twelve wild ducks from over the forest. Each one snapped up his shirt in his bill and flew off with it.",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, now,\" said the King, \"we've plenty of wood, so I believe I'll wait a bit. It is true that these goings-on are strange, but I have a mind to see what the end of this will be.\"",

      "Then the young Queen spoke and told the whole story. The King and all the people listened with wonder and joy. Only the wicked old woman stood trembling with fear. When the Queen had finished her story, the King ordered that the fire be quenched at once, and he took his wife in his arms. He proclaimed that the old witch was banished from the land forever.",

      "his is the tale of Susu, who was the daughter of a very rich man, and a very kind-hearted one, too. Never was a beggar turned from his door, nor was there hunger or want in the length and breadth of his land. And he loved his daughter no less than she loved him. For a long time there was happiness.",
      "\n",
      "Susu's mother had died when she was a small child, and so it came to pass that one day, her father married again. Not long after the wedding, a cloud of grief settled in the maiden's heart, because on a silent, moonlit night when she walked with her father, he told her that he was troubled with a wasting sickness and feared he had not long to live. Some enemy, he said, had cast a spell upon him, so that day by day he grew weaker and weaker and weaker. Because of what her father had told her, Susu was sad and often wandered to a quiet place where she could tell her troubles to the trees.",
      "\n",
      "The stepmother not only disliked Susu, but was very mean and treacherous, hiding her hatred from the father and petting Susu when he was near, stroking her hair and saying pretty things. So well did the wicked woman play her part that nothing could have made the father believe other than that she loved Susu quite as much as he did. For instance, on that moonlit night when he had told his daughter of his trouble, seeing her tears, for she had wept bitterly, he had said, \"But Susu, my dove, your mother will care for you tenderly when I am dead, for she loves you as dearly as I do.\"",
      "\n",
      "At that the girl stifled her sobs and dried her tears, lest the father she loved so well should be wounded by her grief, and seeing her calmed he had supposed that all was well and that his words had soothed her.",
      "\n",
      "But see how it really was with Susu and her stepmother. There was one day, not long after, when father and stepmother and daughter were standing by the fountain, when the man suddenly felt a clutching pain at his heart and was forced to sit down for very weakness. When he felt a little better and the first sharpness of the pain had gone, Susu walked with him to the house, and when he was comfortably seated and had a feather robe cast about him, he bade her to return to her stepmother. That she did, only because he bid her to, since she would have much preferred to sit at his feet. And what was her terror when she came upon the wicked woman talking to a great horned owl that sat in the hollow of an old tree!",
      "\n",
      "Seeing Susu, the stepmother took her by the hand and drew her into a place where they could be seen by the father, yet far enough away to be out of earshot. The father, seeing the woman and the maiden standing thus together, was happy, thinking that his daughter had a friend. It made him happier still to see the woman take Susu's arm and pull it gently around her waist. But he did not hear what was said, for had he heard, it would have cut him to the heart.",
      "\n",
      "This is what the woman said, and her voice was like a poison dart as she whispered loud enough for the owl to hear: \"Susu, stand thus with your arm about my waist so that your father may see us together. Thus he will think that I love you.\" Then she hissed in the girl's ear: \"But I hate you, hate you, hate you.\"",
      "\n",
      "And the owl lifted his head, blew a little and repeated softly, \"Hate you -- Hoo! -- Hoo!\"",
      "\n",
      "From far off in the woods came the sound of an answering owl like an echo: \"Hate you -- Hoo! -- Hoo!\" and it seemed to Susu that all the world hated her for no cause, for the screeching parrots, too, repeated the cry. As for the sweet feathered things that she loved, they had all fled from that place.",
      "\n",
      "Soon the stepmother spoke again and the owl dropped to a lower branch the better to hear. \"Susu,\" said the woman, \"your father cannot live much longer. The spell is upon him and day by day he hears his death. Because of that I am glad, for when he dies, all this land, the house, and all its riches, must be mine, ",
      "mine!",
      ".\"",
      "\n",
      "Hearing that vicious speech Susu was well nigh faint with fear and horror and would have sped to her father to warm him. But the woman caught her by the wrist, twisting it painfully, and pinched the soft place on her arm with her other hand, and stooping again so that it seemed to the watching father that she kissed Susu, she said, \"But see to it that you say no word, for the moment that you say anything but good of me, that moment your father will fall dead.\"",
      "\n",
      "Now while all this was going on there lived in the hills far off a youth, whose name was Huathia. He was a herder of goats and llamas who had seen Susu from a distance in her comings and goings, but never could summon the nerve to speak to her. Brown-haired he was and bright-eyes, too, with clear skin and strong arms, and all who knew him said that he was a good lad.",
      "\n",
      "One day, Susu chanced to see a falcon wheeling high in the air, carrying something in its beak that sent the rays of the sun flashing far, like silver light. Then the bird dipped with the thing it was carrying, looking like a glittering falling star, and Susu for a moment lost sight of the bird as it dropped behind a bush. But it soon rose and took to flight, this time without the shining thing. So Huathia went to the place where the falcon had dropped, and there at the bottom of a little stream she saw a bright round piece of silver.",
      "\n",
      "She rescued it and looked at it with astonishment as it lay in her hand, a polished and smooth disc it was, that reflected her face as clearly as a mirror. So she kept it, wrapping it in a leaf, and took it that night to the place where Huathia lived with another herdsman, a very wise man who knew many strange things, and he told the youth that it was the wonderful mirror of one called Paracaca, long since dead.",
      "\n",
      "He said that whoever looked in it saw his own face as others saw it, but whoever owned the mirror saw something else, \"for,\" added he, \"with it you may see the hidden spirit of other people, seeing through the mask they wear. And if a man has the face of a man but the heart of a fox then certainly while such a man beholds his own face, you shall see the other creature in him.\"",
      "\n",
      "Hearing that, Susu was much amazed at the magic of the thing. The wise man was looking into the mirror himself that very moment, and when Susu looked over his shoulder at his reflection she saw, not the rough bearded face of the man alone, all knotted like a tree trunk, but a face that was full of kindness and gentleness. Husathia stepped up from behind to gaze at the mirror, too, and Susu saw in his reflection a face of eagerness, gentleness and strength. She felt glad of what she saw in them both.",
      "\n",
      "Susu thought that with the mirror she might learn some clue about the mystery disease that ailed her father. And so she asked if one of the two fellows would accompany her back home. Husathia's friend said that he was too old for such adventures, at which Huathia quickly volunteered to come with her. So Huathia gave the care of the goats and llamas to his friend, gathered his arrows and bow, his flute, and after bidding his friend good-bye set off with Susu back to her home.",
      "\n",
      "On the way, he told Susu of a mysterious experience he had had the night before. There had been a thin new moon that night, and the youth had slept but little because of the croaking noise made by the frogs. Presently, fully awake, he had sat up, and it had seemed to him that the air was full of noise, not only of frogs but of the owls and bats. Presently he had seen a great white two-headed toad. Then from rock and hole slithered unclean, abominable creatures of all sorts -- serpents, centipedes, and great gray spiders, and all these creatures had gathered in a circle with the two-headed toad in the center. Soon the youth had heard the great white, two-headed toad say this:",
      "\n",
      "Who knows where hides our queen? Hoo! Hoo!",
      "\n",
      "And first one creature and then another had answered:",
      "\n",
      "The toad, our queen, lies hid unsought",
      "\nBeneath the stone that men have wrought.",
      "\n",
      "And so it went on, a mad and horrible concert, with bat and owl and great ghost moth whirling about on silent wings, until sickened of it all Huathia had risen up and clapping his hands to his ears, fled from the place. Since then Huathia had heard this refrain in his ears:",
      "\n",
      "The toad, our queen, lies hid unsought",
      "\nBeneath the stone that men have wrought.",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely,\" said Susu to Huathia, \"these are strange goings-on. I only wish I could understand what it is all about.\" Speaking thus, Susu and Huathia arrived at her father's house.",
      "\n",
      "It was a day on which the good man was feeling very weak, but seeing that his daughter was pleased with her new companion, he ordered his servants to spread a table under the trees, and the three of them had a feast of goat's milk and fruit, and cassava bread, though the father could eat but little. Then Huathia took out his flute and played music until the world seemed full of peace. Susu, too, sang sweetly, so that for a moment the father thought that the shadow that was upon him was but a dream and might pass. They talked long and long, the three of them.",
      "\n",
      "Then came the stepmother, who fixed her large dark eyes on Susu, not looking at her straight, but sideways. Susu sang to Huathia's flute music again, and it seemed to her pleased father that all on earth that was soft and shapely and fair was gathered there in that garden, until catching the eye of his wife he was reminded that his life was flowing away, and the old grief came upon him.",
      "\n",
      "Somehow talk fell upon Susu, her new mirror and the strange way in which she found it, though no mention was made of its magical qualities. The father came to see this mirror, looking over Huathia's shoulder and seeing his own reflection. But what Susu saw was a face that denoted great bravery and kindness.",
      "\n",
      "Admiring the disc also, the stepmother stretched her hand across the table and took the mirror, gazing at the picture of her own dark beauty. Then Susu stepped to her side and looked into the disc. She saw, not the dark eyes and night-black hair that her stepmother saw, not the face of a proud woman, but the face of a double-headed white toad. Horrified, she continued to gaze, and Susu beheld about her stepmother's neck two writhing white snakes, a sight so horrible she could scarcely prevent herself from calling out. But of all this the stepmother knew nothing and did not even guess that Susu knew her for a vile witch.",
      "\n",
      "The rich man, already tired, stood up and beckoned to the youth to give him an arm. Having found his seat and being wrapped in his feather mantle by Susu, he shivered and held the mantle tightly about him. Huathia shivered, too, and said, \"There is, I am sure, some enchantment in this place, for though the sun is warm I feel a chill, as if some clammy thing enfolded me.\"",
      "\n",
      "All of a sudden, Susu's eyes fell upon a large grindstone that lay nearby. It was a stone so great that two men could hardly raise it, and so it had been left there for years and grasses had grown about it. Susu had seen it there countless times, but this time there leaped into her mind the song that Huathia had heard:",
      "\n",
      "The toad, our queen, lies hid unsought",
      "\nBeneath the stone that men have wrought.",
      "\n",
      "It had meant little before, but in a flash she saw that the grindstone was a stone wrought by man. So she whispered to Huathia to fit an arrow to his bow, to hand her his weapon, and then to lift the stone. With a great effort he raised the stone, heavy though it was, setting it down to one side. And there, in a hollow place where the stone had been, sat a large, white double-headed toad.",
      "\n",
      "\"Shoot, Susu, shoot!\" commanded the father. \"Let not that evil thing escape! It is the creature that torments me in my dreams at night.\"",
      "\n",
      "Swift flew the arrow in Susu's hand and it pierced the body of the toad. At the same moment there fell from the roof of the house two monstrous white serpents where they had lain hidden. Like lightning, Huathia, having seized the bow, sent two arrows flying, and each serpent was cut in half.",
      "\n",
      "In less than three moments three evil things died, and it was like the sun coming from a cloud-veil, the way in which joy came to that place. The weakness of the father fell from him like a cloak. The bodies of the toad and the snakes withered and shriveled, and as a light breeze sprang up, what was left of them was blown away as dust. The whole world seemed to burst into song. So both father and daughter knew then that the witcheries were gone and the evil creatures vanished forever, and that all the trouble that had been upon that place had come from the wicked stepmother.",
      "\n",
      "So youth and maiden were married, and the father soon regained his health and strength, and in all the world there were no happier people than they.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion Questions:",
      "\n",

      "Question 2: Describe a time you helped someone even though you were scared. What happened?",

      "In the long-ago days of the fairies, and ",
      "in a land we now call Sweden, a fairy was riding a coach one day that was drawn by three golden goats.\u00a0 Each goat had a coat of lustrous golden fleece.\u00a0 Suddenly, the three goats broke away from the coach!\u00a0 Dashing, they ran into the fields. ",
      "\n",
      "Three farmhands - Jens, Mats and Ruben - were working in the fields when the golden goats galloped toward them.\u00a0 Much accustomed to runaway animals, the farmhands caught the three goats.",
      "\n",
      "\"What amazing goats!\" said the farmhands, stroking the thick, lustrous golden fleece of the goats. \"Whoever owns them will surely want them back.\"",
      "\n",
      "Soon the fairy arrived She was glad indeed her goats had been safely caught. She said, \"To thank you for catching them, you may keep my goats. That is, for as long as they stay with you.\u00a0 For as you saw, they are frisky.\u00a0 If they get away, they'll come home to be with my other goats.\u00a0 Then you will have a hard time telling which one is yours.\"",
      "\n",
      "Jens, Mats, and Ruben could hardly believe their luck. By sheering the goats' luxurious golden fleece and selling it, they would become rich! As soon as the fairy disappeared into the woods, they quit their jobs and returned to their parent's homes. Mindful of the fairy's warning, Jens branded his goat with tar behind the left ear. Mats branded his with tar between the goat's horns, and Ruben branded his animal under the long chin whiskers. ",
      "\n",
      "Of course the three farmhands had to consider how to keep the prize animals from running away. Jens and Mats tied five ropes around the necks of their goats and hired workmen to hold each of the five ends all night while the goats slept, and during the day while the goats grazed in the pasture. Ruben, however, preferred to watch his goat himself.",
      "\n",
      "As they expected, bundles of golden fleece sold for a high price indeed. Soon the young men were richer than their wildest dreams. They dressed in fine clothes and built palaces for themselves. They started to call themselves Lord Jens and Lord Mats.",
      "\n",
      "Of course, Ruben built himself a palace just as the others had, and he lived and dressed well. Still, he clipped and cared for the goat himself, leading the animal with him wherever he went, petting and talking to him. Finally, the goat became so tame that he didn't need a leash anymore, and followed Ruben like a dog, coming when he whistled. Ruben was even allowed to ride on the goat's back, and they took long trips together.",
      "\n",
      "One day, when Ruben sheared a large chunk of golden fleece, he thought it would be better yet if he could wind it into yarn and sell the ball of yarn at the marketplace. So he placed the fleece on the goat's horn, pulled it across his head and began to twist it. The goat watched the thread grow longer and longer. Suddenly the goat jerked his neck to tighten and stretch it. Ruben might as well have had another person helping him, so well did it go.",
      "\n",
      "When the length of yarn was ready, Ruben wound the yarn on the goat's horn. And the goat moved his head from side to side, just as a person helping someone wind yarn would do. Soon Ruben had large balls of golden yarn, which brought a far better price than the golden fleece. Ruben became known far and wide for his wealth and his generosity in sharing his riches with the needy. Lord Jens and Lord Mats laughingly called him The Goatherd, since he still stooped to the common task of caring for the goat himself.",
      "\n",
      "One morning, a terrible cry shattered the early morning hours. One of the stable boys had fallen asleep, and the goat belonging to Jens had escaped! Tearing his hair and running frantically around, Jens moaned the loss of his prize animal. Finally he slung a knapsack behind his back, set off to find the fairy, and after a long search he found her castle deep in the woods on a hilltop.",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, welcome,\" said the fairy with a smile. \"I thought you'd be here soon, since your goat rejoined us a while ago. Now as I said before, you're welcome to your goat if you can identify him. But if you cannot, things will not go well for you. Do you care to look at the stalls?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Jens with confidence, remembering the tar he had carefully placed behind the left ear. Each goat was in a stall with walls and floors of marble, and he went from stall to stall, examining each golden goat in turn. Yet none had the mark behind the left ear.",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh I wouldn't look for any marks or brands,\" said the fairy, laughing. \"All the goats bathe in my crystal clear stream, and all marks are instantly washed away.\"",
      "\n",
      "Jens groaned. Golden goats looked exactly alike! Yet one of them must be his! He grabbed one that could have been his goat. Though it resisted, he pulled it away until it was bound to leave its stall. Then with a quick motion the goat broke away from Jens' grasp, and with its horns butted him so hard he was thrown out the door, where he rolled and rolled down the hill.",
      "\n",
      "When Jens returned to the village, he found Mats in the same sorry state he had been in before. The workmen hired by Mats had been frightened by a bear rushing out of the woods and they, too, had dropped the ropes and had allowed the goat to escape.",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll never find your goat,\" grumbled Jens. He tried to tell Mats it was hopeless to find his goat from all the rest, but Mats would have none of that, remembering the brand he had put between the goat's horns. And Mats, too, slung a knapsack on his back and set out to find the fairy's castle.",
      "\n",
      "When Mats arrived all the goats looked exactly the same to him. He, too, was butted out the door and rolled down the hill.\u00a0 He returned to the village with his head hung low.",
      "\n",
      "Before you think that Ruben kept his goat without any problems, you should know that not long after that, a lightning storm struck and a flash of lightening frightened Ruben's goat, and it also ran away. Ruben set out to find his goat and came to the fairy's castle. When the fairy told him that all brands and marks disappeared when the goats bathed in the crystal clear stream, Ruben wasn't worried. \"Surely my goat will recognize me,\" he thought.",
      "\n",
      "But when he slowly passed each stall the fairy laughed and said, \"Goats do not have long memories, I'm afraid.\" Ruben felt sad. None of the goats seemed to know him. Could it be that his goat had forgotten all the fine times they had shared together?",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, at least may I clip a lock from each goat?\" he asked the fairy. \"One of the locks will have to be from my goat, and I'll have that as a remembrance.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" said the fairy, and Ruben clipped a small lock from each goat. To make the pile smaller and easier to carry, Ruben tied the fleece to a pump handle and began to twist the yarn into thread. He pulled and twisted, pulled and twisted, as he had done so many times before. One of the goats leaned forward, watching. Suddenly the animal stepped out of his stall, stuck both horns into the wood on the pump handle and began to jerk and pull, stretching the thread. Ruben looked up.",
      "\n",
      "\"My goat! My golden goat!\" he cried in delight. And so Ruben and his goat were reunited. They returned to the village and lived happily ever after.",

      "THERE was once a woman who had two daughters and their names were Millison and Blanche. Millison was nasty-tempered and cruel, while her younger sister Blanche was sweet and cheerful. The mother's favorite was not sweet Blanche, but the sharp-tongued Millison, probably because the older daughter was the very likeness of her own mean self. The mother made Blanche work hard all day long while she and Millison did nothing but loll about from morning to night, spinning tales of how they were bound to live in the city as grand ladies, surrounded by admirers.",
      "\n",
      "One morning the mother sent Blanche to the well to fetch some water in a bucket. When she arrived at the well, the girl saw an old woman, who said to her, \"My little one, I am so terribly thirsty. Do give me some water.\"",

      "\"Thank you, child, you are a good girl!\" said the old woman.",
      "\n",
      "A few days later, the mother scolded Blanche more horribly than she had ever done before, and beat her badly. In terror, the girl ran away into the woods. She cried, and knew not where to go, because she was afraid to return home. When suddenly, standing in front of her, Blanche recognized the same old woman she had met at the well. ",

      "\"Well, then, come with me,\" said the old woman. \"I will give you dinner and a place to sleep. But you must promise me one thing: You must not laugh at anything you will see.\"",
      "\n",
      "She took Blanche's hand and they began to walk into the deep wood. Strangely, thorn bushes opened up by themselves before them and closed behind their backs. A little further on, Blanche saw two axes fighting each another all by themselves. She found such goings-on very odd, but she did not laugh or say anything. They walked further and behold! it was two arms which were fighting; a little further, two legs; at last, she saw two heads fighting by banging their foreheads against each other. All this was strange beyond belief, but Blanche did not laugh or say a word.",

      "\n",
      "\"Make a fire, child, to cook the supper,\" said the old woman, and she sat down near the fireplace. Then she reached up to her head and twisted it off, placing it on her knees like a small round watermelon. ",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Blanche found this the most bizarre thing she had seen yet, but still, she did not utter a sound. Then the old woman began to comb and braid her hair. When she was through, she twisted her head back into place.",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" she said, \"that feels better.\" She gave Blanche a large bone to put on the fire for their supper. Blanche could not imagine how only one bone could make a soup, and a sorry-looking bone at that, but just the same she put the bone in the pot. Lo! in a moment the pot was full of good hearty meat stew.",
      "\n",
      "The old woman gave Blanche a grain of rice to pound with the pestle. Blanche could not see the point of grinding a single grain of rice, but she did so nevertheless. ",

      "When Blanche got up the next morning, the old woman said to her, \"You must go home now. As you've been a good girl I want to make you a present of the talking eggs. Go to the chicken-house. All the eggs that say to you, 'Do not take me,' you must not take. Take only the eggs that say, 'Take me.' When you are on the road, throw the eggs behind your back, one by one, to break them, and you will have a surprise.\"",
      "\n",
      "Blanche went to the chicken-house where, indeed, lay a pile of eggs. Some of them looked as plain as hundreds of chicken eggs Blanche had seen all her life, but others were made of pure gold and were encircled by jewels. ",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it was the plain-looking eggs that called out, \"Take me, take me!\" So Blanche took a few of the plain talking eggs and left the golden ones behind.",
      "\n",
      "Once Blanche was on the road, she threw one of the eggs behind her. In the corner of her eye, she caught a glance of something shining. She turned around and -- imagine her surprise! -- there, amid the broken egg shells, glittered a pile of diamonds! From another broken egg sprang gold jewelry, from another one a beautiful carriage. Yet from another, beautiful dresses beyond belief. ",

      "By the time she arrived at her mother's, she had so many fine things that it wasn't easy to fit them all into the house. Her mother was delighted and pretended to be very glad to see her. The next day at dawn, the mother shook her older daughter awake and whispered to her, \"You, too, must go to the woods to look for this same old woman. There is no reason you shouldn't have even finer dresses than your sister.\"",
      "\n",
      "Millison was not at all pleased at having to get up out of bed so early in the morning. Grumbling and muttering, she marched into the woods. Before long she met the same old woman, who invited her to come to her cabin. The old woman warned her, also, not to laugh at anything she saw. But when Millison saw the axes, the arms, the legs, and the heads fighting, she couldn't help but laugh and laugh. And when the old woman took off her head and set it on her lap to comb and braid her hair, the girl shrieked, pointing... ",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The next day the old woman said to Millison, \"Listen to me. What I am about to tell you is exactly what I told your sister. And like her, out in the chicken-house I believe you will find exactly what you deserve. You must take only the talking eggs that say, 'Take me.' The others you must leave behind. When you throw the eggs behind your back, one by one, you will have a surprise.\"",
      "\n",
      "With glee, Millison rushed into the chicken-house. Like before, the plain-looking ones called, \"Take me, take me!\" while the dazzling, golden eggs were the ones that called, \"Don't take me!\"",
      "\n",
      "In an instant, Millison grabbed as many golden eggs as she could carry and hurried away with them.",
      "\n",
      "As she walked, she broke one egg behind her, and then another. But instead of riches out came a quantity of snakes, toads and frogs, which began to run after her. From other eggs sprang swarms of gnats and mosquitoes, which circled around her head. Millison screamed and ran. ",

      "She arrived at her mother's so tired that she was not able to speak. Blanche knew that to stay at the cabin would mean being blamed for her big sister's troubles. It was clear she must leave at once, but to help her sister, she left behind a quantity of jewels and riches. Gathering the rest of her treasure, she left in her carriage to the city. There she lived the rest of her days as a grand lady, kind to all, surrounded by friends and admirers.",

Sunlight's mother had died when he was a baby, and when he was a young boy his father married again. So Sunlight also lived with his stepmother, the queen, along with her son, a lad named Moonlight.",

She desperately wanted her own son, Moonlight, to be the one to inherit the throne. So, while the two boys lived happily together, never suspecting evil, this wicked woman plotted and schemed to somehow be rid of Sunlight forever.",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She groaned again, this time gasping for breath. \"It is more than your kingdom. It is of such a nature that I dare not speak of it.\" Then she writhed and shuddered as if in worse pain than ever, and the Khan was beside himself to see her suffering so.",

On the third day. they came into a dry, huge desert, with no sign of human life to be seen anywhere, and nothing that could provide water or food. At last, exhausted, Moonlight stumbled and fell on the sand.",

Then he began looking this way and that for some sign of a spring or a waterhole in the desert. At last, his eye was caught by a bright red something on the side of a rocky cliff not far away. He quickened his step to see what it might be and found that it was a great red door set deep into the face of the rock. He rapped upon the door, and soon it was opened by a kindly-looking old man.",

The hermit lost no time in walking with Sunlight back to where his brother lay. Together the two of them carried Moonlight back to the hermit's cave, where the old man used all of his skill to care for the exhausted boy until he was fully recovered.",
      "\n",
      "So the two lads started a new life with the old hermit. Indeed, he soon declared that he could not love them any more if they had been his own sons. So the weeks and months passed, and the three of them lived happily together in their cave behind the red door in the desert.",

Above all else this Khan hated and feared strangers, because it had been foretold that one day he would lose his throne and crown to some lad from a strange land.\u00a0 And so he had made a law that any young man who entered his kingdom from another country would be seized at once by his soldiers and cast into a cave to be devoured by three fierce demon-bears.",

When the soldiers pounded on the red door, the hermit allowed the soldiers to enter.",

Now it happened that the Khan had two children, both daughters, and his elder daughter was at that moment sitting on the low roof of the palace, enjoying the cool early evening air. Looking down into the street below, she saw the line of soldiers riding by, with Sunlight in their midst, his head bowed and his hands bound behind him.

      "Still, she continued to beg her father for the young man's life. At last the Khan's temper broke all bounds. He summoned his soldiers and, pointing to the princess, cried, \"Take her away! She cares more for this upstart stranger than for the safety and throne of her father! Cast her into a dungeon, too, and tomorrow choose two strong sacks.

      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said he. \"And ten times ten alas! That I should die is nothing, for what am I but a stranger and an outcast? But oh, the cruel pity of it, that you, loveliest princess, should perish too!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, fair youth,\" said the Khan's elder daughter. \"Do not mourn for me. I am only an unthinking girl whose life or death can mean nothing to the world - and since it is my father's will that I die in this way, willing am I to obey him. But that you should meet such a cruel fate - and only because you are a stranger! Indeed, that seems more than my sad heart can bear!\"",

      "\n",
      "The unselfishness of these two young mortals moves me to pity!\u00a0 If there is such bravery in the heart's of humans, I am minded never to eat human flesh again!\"",
      "\n",
      "The other two, also being touched by the beauty and nobleness of their captives, readily agreed with the chief, and they resolved to begin at once to be the friends and not the fearful enemies of humans. As they entered the cave, they saw that Sunlight and the princess grew white with terror at the sight of them, so the chief called out, \"Be not afraid! The heart of a demon-bear is not always as cruel as men say! We have come, not to devour you but to set you free. A lad and lass who, in such a dire strait, think only of each other, deserve to live long in peace.",

      "Once freed, the princess went back to her father, who was overcome with sorrow and regret now that his anger had cooled, and Sunlight hastened back to the cave in the desert to relieve the minds of the good old hermit and Moonlight, his faithful brother.",
      "\n",
      "Not long after, as perhaps you supposed, there was a great royal wedding, a double one in fact - for not only did Sunlight marry the lovely elder princess, but Moonlight found an equally beautiful bride in her younger sister.",

      "The prophecy which the Khan had dreaded for so long came true, but in a very different way than he had expected. It turns out that he did indeed lose his throne and crown to a strange lad, but he gave them up of his own free will to Sunlight, because he had grown to love his son-in-law so dearly, and because he was old and weary and had no greater wish in life than to see his elder daughter and her husband ruling over the kingdom. So they all lived happily ever after. And - oh yes! - they soon paid a visit to Sunlight's father and found him grown old and gray, sorrowing for his two dear lost sons. The wicked queen had meanwhile died, just because she was too wicked to live. Sunlight's new father-in-law was happy to offer Sunlight's father a position of great importance at his palace. So the father was reunited with the two young men, and everybody lived happily ever after.",

      "t was an odd sight that greeted two tall, dark, sharp-eared fairies. There under the bushes by the cliffs, was a baby wrapped in its blankets mewing and cooing. Only his wee little face poked through, and not a soul nearby to claim him.",
      "\n",
      "\"I would like such a bairn,\" said one fairy, arching her eyebrow.",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye,\" said the other, looking around. \"No one is around to stop us.\"",
      "\n",
      "In an instant, the two fairies snatched up the bundle in their claw-like arms and vanished.",
      "\n",
      "Just a few minutes later, sailing by the cliffs, two fishermen noticed the figure of a woman fallen on the rocks, her golden locks hanging low.",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis a lass!\" said one.",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't even think of stopping,\" said the other, turning the tiller away from the sharp, rocky cliffs near the shore. \"Our boat will break to pieces!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"But look - she must be injured, or worse,\" said the first. \"We can't go home & have our dinner knowing we left her behind!\"",
      "\n",
      "So the two fishermen carefully anchored their boat on the high, rocky waters by the cliffs and climbed up the rocks to the lass, lying still on the rocks.",
      "\n",
      "\"Think she's still with us?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye,\" said the other, \"but we'd best get her back to the village, right quick.\"",
      "\n",
      "The women of the village nursed the stranger with teas of fern root and violets steeped in whey. At last, the lass opened her eyes.",
      "\n",
      "\"My bairn,\" she murmured. \"Where's my bairn?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Lass,\" said an older woman, worriedly glancing at the other womenfolk. \"You were found quite alone.\"",
      "\n",
      "The lass sat up straight, surprising them all.",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay! \u00a0I bundled my bairn good and safe by the bushes when I went for just a moment to fetch him water. I must have fallen on the rocks.\u00a0 My bairn must still be there!\"",
      "\n",
      "The villagers quickly formed a search team and returned to the cliffs. They searched the whole live long day, tramping up and down the path and all around the area, asking everyone they could find.\u00a0 But no one knew of a baby that had been found by the cliffs.",
      "\n",
      "One of the fishermen had to give the mother the sorry news.\u00a0 \"Stay here in our village with us,\" said he. \"This can be your new home. We have many a fine lad for you to marry. You'll have another bairn before long, no doubt.\"",
      "\n",
      "She drew in her breath. \"Thank you, just the same.\u00a0 I know you mean well. But now I must go to find my bairn.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the lass traveled from farm to village, searching and asking everyone she met about her lost baby. With her hair blown about and a wild expression in her eyes, many thought her crazed, and perhaps she was, a bit.",
      "\n",
      "One day the lass wandered into a camp of gypsies. \"Where is my bairn? Can anyone help me?\" The girl looked so forlorn and weary, a mother with three young children took pity on her. She bid the lass to come inside her tent.\u00a0 She washed the feet of the visitor and fed her from her own pot. \"Where is my bairn?\" was all the girl could say.",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas, I know not,\" said the young mother. \"But my grandmother is the wisest woman I know. If anyone can help you find your little one, it is she.\"",
      "\n",
      "She led the lass to another tent.\u00a0 Inside sat a very wrinkled ancient woman dressed in black from head to toe and sitting at a table. The grandmother heard the sad story.\u00a0 Saying nothing, clasped her hands upon the hands of the lass.\u00a0 And there they sat, hour after hour, hand in hand, till darkness fell. At midnight, the grandmother selected herbs from a basket and scattered them over the fire. The fire leaped up and the smoke that rose from the burning herbs swirled round the old gypsy woman's head. She closed her eyes and listened as the fire burned hot. When it died down, she took the lass's hand again. ",
      "\n",
      "\"Give up thy search, poor lass,\" said the grandmother sorrowfully. \"For thy baby has been stolen away by the fairies. Taken to live with them, he was. It's best that you accept it, lass. The fairies are far more powerful than we mortals.\"",
      "\n",
      "The lass was silent. Then she said, darkly, \"If I cannot get back my bairn, I might as well lay down and die.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"No, child!\" urged the old grandmother, tears welling in her eyes. \"Perhaps there is a way...\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" whispered the lass. \"A spell?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, if only it were that easy!\" said the ancient gypsy grandmother. \"The fairies are a vain people who enjoy rare and beautiful things, but they have no art. If they see something exquisite, something very rare and extraordinary, they will want it.\u00a0 And if you have such an unusual item, you might be able to bargain with them. But it would have to be something without equal anywhere in the world. And I'm afraid you would need two such treasures - one to gain entrance inside the fairy mound, where they live.\u00a0 And another to bargain with for your babe.\"",
      "\n",
      "The old woman sighed. \"What's more, the time for you to obtain two treasures is short. If only you had 10 years! But the truth is, in 10 days the fairy people will gather together from all corners of the earth to choose a new ruler for the next 100 years. Your baby is sure to be among them for the event. After that, who knows where your babe might go? And now,\" she said, \"there is only more thing I can do for you.\"",
      "\n",
      "The old gypsy grandmother laid one hand on the girl's head and cast a spell to protect her from fire and earth, wind and water. Unable to do anything more, they bid goodbye.",
      "\n",
      "Uplifted by the notion that she might, after all, find her baby, the lass went on her way. Then suddenly, she felt as if she had struck her head on the cliffs once again. How could she, penniless as she was, ever obtain a rare and exotic treasure, much less two?",
      "\n",
      "Her head spinning, she lay a hand on a tree to steady herself. What items do people speak of in wonder? All she could think of were two legendary items from kings of yesteryear - the famous white cloak of King Nechtan and the golden stringed harp of King Wrad. Suddenly she knew what she must do.",
      "\n",
      "The lass headed straight to the shore, where large seabirds called eider ducks nested.\u00a0 On the beach were the fur sheddings from the ducks.\u00a0 Soft down duck fur that had shed from their breasts, and delicate white feathers that had rolled off their wings. She clambered up and down the rocks gathering the cottony down and the clusters of white feathers. Sharp rocks scraped her feet but did not pierce her skin, the hot sun burnt in the sky but that did not redden her face.\u00a0 The wind splashed the waves on the rocks but her dress and legs stayed dry. Ah, she thought with warm gratitude, the spell of the gypsy grandmother was shielding her from the ill effect of earth and fire, wind and water.",
      "\n",
      "The lass gathered all the down and feathers she needed.\u00a0 Then she set to weaving the down into a large cloak.\u00a0 The cloak was so soft and thick that it looked as if a tuft of cloud had been plucked from the sky. Then to decorate border around the cloak, she wove the delicate white feathers around the edges. In three quick strokes, she cut off her long golden hair that had fallen to her waist. Setting aside one strand of her locks for later, she took the rest and wove the strands into the feathered border, making golden flowers and leaves, all glimmering and resplendent. ",
      "\n",
      "Day and night she worked for there was not a moment to lose. After she had stitched the final stitch, she carefully folded the soft white cloak, laid it under a shrub and returned to the seashore.",
      "\n",
      "Searching the sandy beach, the lass looked for the right shape of bones to make a frame for a harp. Luckily she discovered an arc of bone that had been washed by the waves to such a smooth perfection that it resembled ivory. Taking the bone back to the shrub, she tied it together to make a frame for a harp. From the lock of hair she had set aside before, she braided each of her tiny hairs into thin strands, then twisted several thin strands together to form strong, elegant strings for the harp. She stretched the strings tight and set them in tune.\u00a0 When she plucked a note, it was so full of longing and grief that even the birds winging their way to the sea stopped in mid-air for a moment and cocked their heads to hear.",
      "\n",
      "The lass wrapped her cloak around her shoulders, held the harp to her chest and set out to the mound where the fairies were known to live. As she traveled, villagers stepped aside for her to pass, according her the respect due a princess. But of this she noticed nothing, and continued along the high road and the byroad, her eyes fixed straight ahead.\u00a0 At last, as the moon rose full, she reached the entrance of the fairy mound. She spread her billowing cloak upon the path and stepped aside.",
      "\n",
      "Before long a fairy strode toward her.",
      "\n",
      "The fairy pointed at her. \"You! No humans are allowed here. Leave at once!\"",
      "\n",
      "The fairy noticed the white cloak. \"Hmm,\" she said.\u00a0 \"Finders keepers.\" And she stooped for it.",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay!\" said the lass. \"It's mine. You cannot have it!\" She quickly snatched the cloak from the ground, cleverly wrapping it round her shoulders so it swirled around her body, its folds glimmering in the sun and its golden threads shining.",
      "\n",
      "\"Mortal, don't be a fool! I'll give you a handful of gold for it.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"This cloak is not for sale. 'Tis embroidered with my own golden hair, and there's none like it in the world!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"No amount of gold?\" scoffed the fairy. \"You make me laugh - all you humans crumble at the first glint of gold. Very well, I'll fill your pockets with gold and all you can hold in your arms. There! Are you satisfied now?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"The cloak is not for sale for ANY",
      "\u00a0",
      "amount of gold,\" she repeated, \"nor for any regular price.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"WHAT then?\" said the fairy, sensing a bargain could be struck.",
      "\n",
      "\"Take me with you inside the fairy mound. Then the cloak will be yours and you're welcome to it.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What a fool,\" mumbled the fairy, but she took the lass by the hand and together, they entered the fairy mound. Once inside, the fairy snatched the soft white cloak from the lass's shoulders, and the girl let it go with a smile. Glancing back, she saw the fairy showing off the cloak and a crowd of other tall, dark fairies surrounding her, touching it, begging to be allowed to try it on, please, just once. But the lass headed straight forward, harp in hand, until she spied at the edge of the mound a high throne.\u00a0 Sitting on the throne was a tall, forbidding, sharp-eared creature, with his eyebrows deep cast into a frown, who she realized must be the new king of the fairies.",
      "\n",
      "Fearlessly she approached the throne.",
      "\n",
      "\"You dare to approach the throne!\" hissed the king. \"How did you - a human! - get inside the fairy mound?\"",
      "\n",
      "The lass pointed to the fairy who had admitted her. The white-cloaked fairy turned and said, \"Your Highness, she entered with me.\" The king frowned.",
      "\n",
      "\"And what have you there?\" said he, nodding to the harp she clutched to her breast.",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis my harp,\" said she.",
      "\n",
      "\"I have harps a'plenty,\" shrugged the king.",
      "\n",
      "\"Not like this,\" said the lass, and she plucked a few chords, ringing notes so pure and transcendent that the king stared in wonder.",
      "\n",
      "\"You offer this as a gift for me, the new king of the fairies?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"The harp might be a gift under the right circumstance,\" the lass said quickly. \"It's not for sale for any usual price.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"It's naught but a common harp and you know it,\" shrugged the king. \"You think too much of your little toy.\" Then he cunningly added, \"but I could take it off your hands. What do you want for it?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"The harp is beyond price,\" said the lass. \"'Tis woven from my own golden hair.There's none like it in the world. There's only one trade of interest to me.\" The king arched one eyebrow. \"My bairn!\" she said. \"Give me my bairn that was taken by the fairies after I left him in his blankets by the black cliffs. My bairn back, and the harp is yours!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" He was not anxious to let go of the chubby-cheeked infant, held deep in the woods. He ordered a few of the fairies to bring gold, and they piled armfuls of the precious nuggets around the youn woman's ankles. \"Surely,\" he sneered, \"that's more than enough payment for a common harp.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Ooch, I do not want your gold!\" she cried. \"My bairn! I want my bairn and naught else!\"",
      "\n",
      "He clicked his fingers, and more fairies brought more armfuls of precious stones, this time of emeralds and rubies that heaped over the gold until a great pile of jewels rose to her waist.",
      "\n",
      "Without looking once at the jewels she stared at the king.\u00a0 Said she with steely eyes: \"My bairn! Give me my bairn and naught else!\"",
      "\n",
      "When he saw that she could not be moved, the king barked, \"So take the brat - what do I care?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me the bairn first, then the harp,\" said she, knowing full well that if she let go of the harp first, she'd never see her baby again.",
      "\n",
      "The king clicked his fingers.\u00a0 Before long, the baby was brought to his side. At once the infant recognized its mother and reached out. The lass gripped the harp tightly, her chin up.\u00a0 She repeated, \"Give me the bairn first.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the baby was returned to its mother, and the lass gave the harp to the king. He struck a few chords and the purest and sweetest melody every heard in the fairy kingdom rang out. All the fairies gathered round, delighting in the talents of their new king and vigorously nodding their heads with admiration.",
      "\n",
      "Clutching her baby, the lass turned from the king, quickened out of the fairy mound, and headed to the fisherfolk who had cared for her so tenderly. Overjoyed were they that she had returned to their village - and with her bairn, no less! And that is where the lass and her little one stayed for many happy years.",

      "N THE MOUNTAINS OF POLAND there once lived a miller and his three daughters. All the eldest daughter loved to do was to gaze at herself in a mirror or in a pond, turning to one side for a pose, taking up her hair to see if that looked more fetching, then letting it down again with a flounce. The middle daughter spent her days dancing about, skipping everywhere, twirling and dipping.",
      "\n",
      "The youngest of the father's three daughters was quieter. Often she was lost in thoughts or daydreams. But she adored her two older sisters, and would clap with delight at her eldest sister's choice of red ribbons for the ends of her braids, then clap a beat for her other sister to dance circles around her.",
      "\n",
      "The father dearly loved all three daughters, but sometimes wished he could teach them to read. Only a couple of people in the village knew how to read, but they were too busy or important for the father to ask, and besides, he had no extra coins in his pocket to pay for lessons even if he could approach them.",
      "\n",
      "One autumn day a shivering old woman knocked on the father's door asking for a bite to eat. He quickly ushered her inside, offered her a bowl of hearty bean stew with sausage, and a place by the fire. After dinner the old woman took out a book and started to read quietly to herself. At once the father said, \"May I ask, dear woman, if you would consider staying here with my family for the winter? You'll have a soft bed and warm meals, and in return would you give reading lessons to my daughters?\"",
      "\n",
      "It was agreed, and the first lesson was scheduled for the very next morning. The eldest daughter would have come, but she disappeared in the fields to gather wildflowers for a party that night. The middle daughter would have come, too, but a traveling minstrel was passing through town with an accordion, and she couldn't miss dancing to that pumping beat. Only the youngest daughter was there for the lesson. And with the gentle teachings of the old woman, the maiden started to make sense of the strange-looking squiggles on the page.",
      "\n",
      "That evening, the father scolded his two older daughters. They hung their heads and said they were very sorry and promised to come the next morning. But alas! after breakfast the eldest daughter rushed off for thread to sew embroideries on her blouse and the middle daughter had to practice a new dance step while it was still fresh in her mind, and so it was the youngest daughter again who alone studied with the old woman.",
      "\n",
      "So it went, day after day. Each night the father reprimanded his two older daughters and they pledged to come to lessons the next morning without fail. But one thing or another got in the way and it was only the youngest daughter who learned to read.",
      "\n",
      "One day an evil enchanter came to the village looking for a wife. Perhaps he wouldn't seem evil to you or anyone else by looking at him - he only seemed rich - and so the eldest daughter allowed herself to be flattered by his attentions. Before long, she agreed to become his wife, and the day after the wedding the enchanter whisked away his bride to his home at a faraway castle. There, he told her, she could enjoy dozens of expensive dresses and vests, and jewels to adorn her hair.",
      "\n",
      "The enchanter's castle was truly marvelous to behold, and the wardrobes in the bedrooms were indeed packed with long ruffled skirts with sheer aprons, full-sleeved blouses, and vests richly decorated with beadwork and embroidery. The drawers were filled with headscarves of all colors and heaping piles of beads. On most walls rested huge framed mirrors. The eldest daughter was utterly delighted and marveled at her good fortune.",
      "\n",
      "One day her new husband said, \"I need to go away for awhile. Anytime you're hungry, just go to the dining room, sit at the dining room table, close your eyes, and imagine what you'd like to eat. A steaming hot feast will appear before you. But,\" he frowned, \"there is one thing you must know. You must ",
      "never ",
      "go into the room at the end of the corridor.\"",
      "\n",
      "It was easy enough to agree to that, and the eldest daughter promised she would never do such a thing. Yet as days passed, after the thrill of dressing up wore off - after all, who was there to dress ",
      "for? ",
      "- the idea of taking just the tinest peek at the room took hold on her. Before long there was nothing else she could think of, until she absolutely had to venture to the room.",
      "\n",
      "But the moment she pushed open the door the smallest crack, it flung wide open and she was pulled in, much against her will. Then the door slammed shut behind her and she realized she was locked inside. When the enchanter returned, he knew instantly what had happened while he had been gone. He stormed inside the room. \"You disobeyed me!\" he thundered, pointing at her, \"You are no longer my wife!\" The next instant, the eldest daughter was transformed into a yellow songbird trapped in a gilded birdcage.",
      "\n",
      "Back to the village went the evil enchanter. When the middle daughter saw him gallop toward the town square, she ran to him eagerly and asked for news of her big sister. \"Why not visit and see for yourself?\" said he. \"In my castle, you may be interested to know, I have the finest selection of musical instruments in all the land.\"",
      "\n",
      "She happily agreed, and said goodbye to her family. When the enchanter arrived with his new charge, he told her that her big sister was at market for a short while but would soon return. In the meantime, she was welcome to amuse herself all she liked with the musical instruments in his castle. He had business to attend to, he told her, and must leave, and gave the middle daughter the same instructions he had given her older sister. She could roam anywhere in the castle and indulge her heart's content at the magical dining room table, but must not, under any circumstance, enter the room at the end of the corridor.",
      "\n",
      "At first the middle sister was content to admire and play the gleaming fiddles and violins, accordions and flutes. But it wasn't long before the notion grew on her, too, that she would like a glimpse of the forbidden room. Soon she couldn't even keep the beat to the music since thoughts about the room pushed everything else away. \"My goodness, I might as well get it over with and take a look in that room or I'll never have a moment's peace.\"",
      "\n",
      "But alas! \u00a0like her sister, the moment she opened the door the smallest crack, it flew wide open and powerfully drew her inside. Then the door slammed shut, sealing her in.",
      "\n",
      "When the enchanter returned, he knew at once where the middle sister had been. He charged into the forbidden room, shouting, \"You are just like your sister! You will share her fate!\" The next moment she, too, was transformed into a yellow songbird inside a gilded cage.",
      "\n",
      "Back home at the village, a long time had passed with no letter or message from either sister. The youngest daughter was beginning to worry. When the enchanter appeared at the village, she was very relieved and plied him with anxious questions. \"Oh, they are very happy,\" he assured her. \"So busy they don't even have time to write a note. But they both asked me to come here and tell you they'd like it very much if you came for a visit.\" The youngest sister agreed, though she thought it strange that neither sister had accompanied him.",
      "\n",
      "The youngest sister was also very impressed with the enchanter's castle, and the stacks of books in nearly every room. Because as I'm sure you have guessed by now, the evil enchanter could determine whatever was dearest to a young woman's heart and fill the castle with those very objects.",
      "\n",
      "The enchanter urged the daughter to make herself comfortable, saying that both her sisters would surely return soon, warning her not to go into the room at the end of the corridor, which was forbidden, and letting her know what to do when she got hungry.",
      "\n",
      "The youngest daughter would have been content for days waiting for her two sisters, with all the lovely illustrated books for her to pore through, but thoughts of that room at the end of the corridor simply grew and grew, until she couldn't focus on a page another moment.",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is it such a terrible thing to look in that silly room?\" she thought. She carefully stepped to the door at the end of the corridor. Ever so slowly she turned the latch so it didn't make a sound. Yet the moment she pushed the door open the smallest crack it flung fully open and the maiden was pulled inside, even though she grabbed hold of the doorway and tried to hold on all with all her might.",
      "\n",
      "Then slam! The door locked shut, sending a whoosh of wind that blew her hair and caused something behind her to rustle. Turning around, she noticed a bookstand in the middle of the room holding open a large dusty volume with some of its pages rustling from the wind. As she stepped toward the book, she noticed something else - at one end of the room were rows and stacks of gilded birdcages, each one containing a yellow songbird, and each bird chirping wildly. Tears welled up as she bemoaned her lost freedom, missing sisters, and the cruel fate that was sure to follow. Then it hit her. First her eldest sister had disappeared, then her next eldest sister. Then she finds herself mysteriously imprisoned in this room filled with caged birds. Could it be her sisters had also been trapped, then changed into birds? Could the other birds also be maidens suffering the same fate? And what about that large opened book - could it have a clue?",
      "\n",
      "Anxiously she searched the pages. \u00a0It was a large spell book with frightening illustrations drawn in the margins and spells she could barely pronounce. Which one could undo her sisters' enchantment? A distant sound of footsteps meant the enchanter was entering the castsle. Frantically she skimmed the pages - there was a spell for making oneself irresistible, another for revealing a person's deepest desire, another for starting fire, one for taming dragons, one for turning creatures into mice... \u00a0Her head pounded with exasperation. Closer and louder than ever came the footsteps until with a furious final stomp, the enchanter lunged into the room.",
      "\n",
      "\"How ",
      "dare ",
      "you?\" he roared. He pointed his bejeweled finger at her. At once, the youngest sister called out: \"Bejackle wex!\" \u00a0Instantly all the caged birds were restored to full-length young maidens, including her two older sisters. Seeing the door open, they dashed out, pushing the surprised enchanter while rushing past. After the last maiden fled, he cursed in a rage, then turned to chase after them with fury.",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed, the youngest daughter saw him catching up. Before he could enchant them again she pointed and called out: \"Reductus mousamillus!\" - the last spell she had seen - and at once the enchanter shrunk into a tiny mouse.",
      "\n",
      "The maidens cheered but the youngest daughter knew that even as a mouse, he was still dangerous. A birdcage trailed behind one of the maiden's skirts (her spell didn't work perfectly after all), so quickly the youngest daughter took the birdcage, trapped the mouse into a corner, forced it into the cage, then shut and locked the cage door.",
      "\n",
      "The youngest daughter and her two sisters returned home, where they joyfully embraced their father. The youngest daughter set down the locked cage, and it wasn't long before their house cat found a way to unlatch the cage and have a morsel of mouse treat.",
      "\n",
      "And so the evil enchanter was vanquished. The sisters enjoyed a heartfelt family reunion, and all of them lived happily ever after.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion Questions:\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Question 1:\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Learning to read saved the youngest sister from the evil enchanter. Tell about something you learned to do that one day came in very handy to know.",

      "Illustrated By: ",
      "Jacob Below",
      "\n",
      "MANY years ago, in a faraway country, there lived six young men who were very good friends. One was the son of a magician, one the son of a blacksmith, the third a son of a doctor, the fourth the son of a woodcarver, the fifth the son of a painter, and the sixth the son of a prince. All these six lads intended to follow the lives and the work of their fathers.\u00a0 But before settling down, they all desired to seek some great adventure.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us go forth together,\" said they, \"and travel into some strange country. Perhaps something wonderful may happen to us that will make us rich to the end of our days.\u00a0 Or at least we will have a good tale to tell our neighbors when we return and take up our fathers' work.\"",
      "\n",
      "So on a certain day, very early in the morning, all six started out together. For several days they traveled, going\u00a0 far past the familiar lands in the country they knew. Yet no adventure whatsoever befell them.",
      "\n",
      "At last they came to a small, round pond. Six streams emptied into the pond. The blacksmith's son said, \"Friends, here are six streams, one for each of us to follow. How about if each of us goes our own way to see what adventure we may find?\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The other five agreed. \"Listen,\" said the son of the magician, \"let us each plant a small tree where the stream that we choose meets the pond. I will weave a spell on all the trees.\u00a0 If trouble comes to the one who planted the tree, the tree will wither away.\u00a0 That way, if one of us comes back and sees a tree withered, he can follow the stream and try to find the one who needs help.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's another thought,\" said the doctor's son. \"Let us all agree to return to this spot at the end of one year and a day. That way, we will be together at one time.\u00a0 If one of us is missing and his tree withered, we can all follow the stream together to try and find the one who's in trouble.\"",
      "\n",
      "And so the six trees were planted. The magician's son went around from one tree to the next, weaving a magic spell about it so that it would wither and die if any trouble came to the one who had planted it.\u00a0 Then, with many handshakes and affection, the six friends parted.\u00a0 Each one disappeared up the bank of the stream he had selected.",
      "\n",
      "Now we are going to follow the son of the prince. The underbrush along the bank of his stream was thick and heavy, so he needed to walk slowly. At last, however, the banks of the little river began to clear and widen. By sunset he found himself in an open meadow with an old broken well in the middle, and a dark forest beyond. He was tired and worn out with the long hard walk.\u00a0 So when he reached the well, he sat down beside it to rest and cool himself.",
      "\n",
      "He had not been at the well long before he saw approaching him a tall and graceful young woman with a water pitcher on her shoulder.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Her hair was very long and black. The young woman was clothed in flowing white linen garments and she moved across the field barefooted, with a light, airy step. Marvelous to behold, wherever her foot pressed the soft earth, a white flower sprang into bloom, marking her course across the meadow in a trail of beauty. ",
      "\n",
      "While the prince's son was marveling at this, she drew up to the well and lowered her pitcher from her shoulder. He jumped up at once. Taking it from her hand, he offered to draw the water for her. She said not a word, but smiled.\u00a0 Her smile was so warm that he felt right away he would want to be with this young woman forever.\u00a0 When he had filled the pitcher, she set forth again across the meadow, seeming to invite him to follow her and to carry the pitcher. This he did gladly.\u00a0 Over the field and into the woods they went, into the deepening twilight.",
      "\n",
      "At last they came to a little log hut with a candle shining in the window. As they approached it, the door was opened by an old man, white-haired, shriveled and bent, with an old, wrinkled woman beside him.",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in, daughter,\" said the aged man, motioning to the girl. \"Have you brought the son of the prince?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"That I have, Father,\" she replied. Her voice was as warm as her smile. The prince's son entered the little hut, wondering greatly about all of this.",
      "\n",
      "At once, the old couple hurried about preparing and serving the prince a simple, hearty supper. ",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the young woman had disappeared into an inner room. When he finished eating, the old man said, \"You are doubtless wondering, my son, about the lovely damsel who lives here with us, and whom you have followed this day to our humble door. But in truth, sir, we know very little about her ourselves. We do not even know where she comes from, though we have cherished and reared her as our own daughter for years.",
      "\n",
      "\"When she was a young girl we found her on our doorstep, a little laughing maid as lovely as ever the sun looked on.\u00a0 She was draped in the softest, richest fabrics. Joyfully we took her in, and she has lived with us happily ever since.\u00a0 Yet never has she said a word by which we might know whose child she was. A king's daughter she must be, or the child of some good spirit. Lately, she has spoken much of a change to come in her life, of a prince's son, and of many other things we did not understand. But our hearts have been sad, fearing that our girl would soon marry and separate from us who love her more than anything else in the whole world.\"",
      "\n",
      "The prince's son eagerly interrupted the old man, saying, \"I am indeed the son of a prince.\u00a0 And I know in my heart I have no other wish in life but to marry this wonderful maiden, the daughter you raised.\u00a0 I would live with her right here in this forest, in a house that I shall build myself near this hut.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said the old man. \"You must be the destined bridegroom, the son of a prince!\u00a0 For had it been otherwise our daughter never would have led you through the dark forest to our lonely home. Let our best wishes rest upon you.\"",
      "\n",
      "And so it came about that the prince's son married the marvelous maiden of the woods and lived with her in peace and happiness in a little log house near her foster-parents' hut.",
      "\n",
      "One warm afternoon, the two had strolled hand in hand down to the bank of a stream that ran through the forest. The water looked so very cool and refreshing that the maiden felt she must sit on the mossy bank and dabble her feet and her hands in it. Running her hands under the surface of the cool water, a ring slipped from her finger. Before she could rescue it, it was whisked downstream and out of sight. The poor girl cried out in dismay.\u00a0 She was beside herself in despair.",

      "\n",
      "\"That ring,\" said the girl in a choked voice, \"is a magic one. Its loss will bring us both terrible trouble.\"",
      "\n",
      "The ring was carried away for a long distance and finally washed ashore near the gardens of the Khan, the great ruler of the land. There a traveler found it. Seeing that it was a strange ring, perhaps from another land, the traveler took it at once to the Khan himself. ",
      "\n",
      "The monarch gazed long upon it.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Then calling his ministers about him, he said, \"This trinket has magic power about it, of that I am sure. I believe that it belongs to a enchanting woman, perhaps the daughter of a king. Take it, therefore.\u00a0 Wherever the ring leads you, follow. If its owner indeed proves to be a marvelous damsel, as believe it does, take her prisoner and bring her at once to me, that she may serve as head over my household.\"",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Khan's advisor held the magic ring in his hand, he felt a strange power tugging at him. The ring seemed to draw him out of the palace gardens toward the bank of a stream, and then along the stream to the log hut in the woods. And so in a very short time, the Khan's advisor and all his soldiers and servants were standing before the door of the little house where the prince's son and his new wife had been living so happily together, and were shouting at them to come out at once. The two dared not disobey.\u00a0 And so the damsel was quickly seized and taken away to the Khan's palace.",
      "\n",
      "The Khan was delighted with the young woman and paid not the slightest heed to her tears or pleadings to be allowed to return to her husband. She was made the head of the royal servants, and was set up to live in the palace within constant call of the Khan.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no possible hope of escape. Days passed by. Her sorrow and longing for her husband became ever greater instead of less, until she began to grow pale and thin, and those about her feared she would soon sicken and die. The Khan, too, noticed the change in her. He tried every means in his power to cheer her, but all in vain. At last he grew angry.",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all the fault of that husband of hers!\" he cried. \"He is the one who is making my favorite servant look so sickly and plain. Well, I know how to take care of that!",
      "\n",
      "Calling the court executioner, he whispered a few words in his ear.",
      "\n",
      "\"There now,\" he said later to the damsel after the executioner had left, \"when you know that your husband is dead and there is no use in wishing for him any longer, then perhaps you will forget him and learn to smile again.\"",
      "\n",
      "In vain did the poor girl plead with the monarch for her husband's life! But the more she cried out and begged, the angrier and more determined the Khan became.",
      "\n",
      "So the executioner set out with a number of soldiers. Finding the log hut in the woods, he dragged the prince's son away and took him to a meadow where there was a dry, deserted well. Down into the well the poor lad was thrown, and a great rock was rolled over the opening. There in the darkness he laid down to die, with no hope of rescue and no desire for life, anyway, if he could not live it with his dear wife.",
      "\n",
      "Now it happened that the very next day was the year-and-a-day on which the six friends had agreed to meet by the little round pond with the six streams running into it. True to their promise, the other five gathered together and awaited the arrival of the prince's son. While they waited, they eagerly told one another all about the adventures they had. In this way, most of the day passed. When the prince's son still did not appear, the friends noticed that the tree which he had planted was drooping and withering.",
      "\n",
      "\"Our friend must be in danger or trouble!\" said the doctor's son. \"Let's lose no time in searching for him. Even now we may be too late to save him!\" The others were alarmed and eager to start at once.\u00a0 But the magician's son held up his hand.",
      "\n",
      "\"One moment!\" he said. \"By my magic art I can learn exactly where our friend is. Then we can go straight to him without any further loss of time.\"",
      "\n",
      "Bidding the others to sit down and wait, he drew a circle on the ground. Placing himself in the center of the circle, he began to recite all sorts of stra",
      "nge words and to draw figures and signs in the air. After awhile he erased the circle and announced to his friends that he knew the exact whereabouts of the prince's son at that moment.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"But we must hurry,\" he said, \"for he is in great danger and will surely die unless we rescue him right away!\"",
      "\n",
      "So the five set out at a quick pace and traveled all night without rest. By early morning they had reached the well where the prince's son was imprisoned.",
      "\n",
      "\"But how shall we move away the rock?\" they all cried in despair, seeing the huge boulder completely covering the mouth of the well.",
      "\n",
      "\"I know how to move it!\" said the blacksmith's son. Taking the heavy iron hammer which he always carried in his belt, he fell to work upon the rock, knocking great chunks out of it until it was all broken to pieces.",
      "\n",
      "When the mouth of the well was opened, they hastily lowered the doctor's son, who found the son of the prince lying there quite white and still and close to death.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"It is well they chose me to fetch him!\" he muttered as he drew forth his bag of medicines. He poured some red liquid down the throat of his unconscious friend, who soon began to stir and then to sit up.",
      "\n",
      "With great difficulty the two young men were hauled up to the mouth of the well. Once they were once safely out of it, the friends all embraced with heartfelt joy and affection. Then the prince's son told the tale of his adventure and its sorry ending.\u00a0 The other five were full of compassion for him and anger toward the wicked Khan.",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, the wood-carver's son spoke up. \"I have an idea!\" he said. \"I can fashion a great wooden bird, large enough to carry a man, and I will fit it with wings, hinges and springs so that it can fly through the air!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"And I,\" cried the painter's son, catching the idea at once, \"will paint and decorate it with marvelously beautiful colors, so that it will look like a magnificent, magical bird!\"",
      "\n",
      "They were all much excited by this time and begged the wood-carver's son to tell them more.",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said he, \"the prince's son shall fly in my wonder bird to the palace of the Khan--\"",
      "\n",
      "\"And,\" interrupted the painter's son, \"when that wicked ruler sees the beauty and the color of it, he will believe it is a magical bird.\u00a0 He will go up to the roof to receive it, with all of his royal household, and then - and then -\"",
      "\n",
      "\"You can snatch up your wife and carry her away!\" they all shouted at once to the prince's son, who was trembling with joy and hope.",
      "\n",
      "The wood-carver's son fell to work at once, and in no time at all had built a marvelous wooden bird, big and strong and powerful, with great broad wings that would carry it through the air at the touch of a spring. Then the painter's son got out his paints and decorated it with colors so rich and fair that it shone with beauty. The prince's son got into it as soon as it was ready. Amid the shouts of his friends, he pressed a button and flew high up into the air. Off he steered, straight for the Khan's royal dwelling.",
      "\n",
      "Great was the excitement at the palace when the big colored bird was seen flying overhead. Everybody rushed about, asking what it might mean. The Khan was the most excited one of them all.",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be a magical being!\" he cried, \"for don't you see the gold on its wings? It must be delivering a special message for me! In truth, we must meet this noble bird in the proper way!\" So he called together all his royal servants. Choosing his favorite servant, the maiden who was married to the prince's son, he bade her to go quickly to the roof and welcome the magical messenger as the bird landed.",
      "\n",
      "The damsel hastened to obey and stood waiting and marveling as the great wooden monster drew near. Imagine her surprise when it came whirring to a standstill, revealing her own dear husband seated within it! In a flash he caught her up by the waist. Before the astonished Khan and his court could realize what was happening, the magical bird had soared into the air and was only a vanishing speck in the sky.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince's son and his lovely wife, whose ring, much to her delight, was magically restored to her finger, returned along with the five faithful companions to see her old foster-father and foster-mother from the hut in the woods. Then all of them together returned to the land where the six friends had been born. They visited each of their families, told one and all of their marvelous adventures, and there they settled and were happy and prosperous to the end of their days.",

When Prince Miliflor was born, Fairy Flight had bestowed on him all the graces of mind and body that a prince could possibly wish. But now she doubled her efforts and spared no pains in adding every imaginable charm and fascination. So that whether he happened to be cross or cheerful, dressed in the most luxurious royal fineries or simplest robes, whether he was serious or light-hearted, he was always perfectly irresistible! In truth, he was an utterly charming young fellow, since Fairy Flight had given him the best heart in the world as well as the best head, and had left nothing to be desired except the ability to stay faithful to one love. For it cannot be denied that Prince Miliflor was a desperate flirt, and as fickle as the wind. So much so, that by the time he arrived at his eighteenth birthday he had conquered and left behind every heart in the kingdom. Things were in this state when he was invited to visit the court of his father's friend, the king and queen who had raised the twelve baby princesses.",

And in his more serious moments what could be more pleasant than to talk to Wise upon some shady lawn, while he held the hand of Loving in his own, with all the others lingering nearby? For the first time in his life he really loved, though the object of his devotion was not one person, but twelve, to whom he was equally attached. Fairy Flight could not be more pleased.

As the humming became louder, the ladies of the court, fearing their stings, uttered little shrieks and fled.\u00a0 Immediately, to the horror of all who were looking on, the bees suddenly grew to enormous size, then each one chased a princess, finally pounding on her and carrying her off into the air! In an instant all twelve princesses had disappeared into the sky.",

      "This amazing occurrence plunged the whole court into the most terrible grief. It was bad enough that the baby Rosenella had vanished so mysteriously years before from her royal cradle, but now this! That all twelve princess would be carried off by giant bees! Prince Miliflor cast about in a violent rage, then gradually fell into such a deep state of depression it was feared that if nothing could rouse him that he would surely die. His protector, Fairy Flight, rushed to his side, but he rejected with scorn all the portraits of lovely princesses which she offered him to replace his lost beauties. ",

      "One day, as the prince wandered about absorbed in his sorrow, he heard sudden shouts. Through the air a chariot of crystal, glittering in the sunshine, was slowly approaching. Six lovely maidens with shining wings drew it by rose-colored ribbons, while a whole flight of others, equally beautiful, were holding long garlands of roses crossed above it, so as to form a complete canopy.

He had scarcely been five minutes in the presence of Rosanella before it seemed to the prince that she combined in her own charming person all the gifts and graces which had so attracted him in the twelve Rose-Maidens whose loss he had so truly mourned.

The old King growled to the Queen that it was lucky for them both that the Fairy had said it would be so. He would save the baby's life to become the future bride for his son.\u00a0 From the highest room of the tower the Fairy and Queen could hear the King's son shrieking and demanding that his servants do this and that from way down below, his mean voice carrying over all other voices and noises. The King thundered that if the Fairy had made a different forecast, both the baby and her mother would immediately have been hanged.

At last, one evening, as the Queen sat at her spinning-wheel - for she was also made to work day and night - she saw a tiny, pretty little mouse creep out of a hole.

To test you I took the form of the old woman whom you talked to from the window.\u00a0 I tempted you to forsake your little mouse friend. But this you did not do!

      "n Cambodia there once lived a wealthy princess by the name of Amaradevi who was an educated and talented young woman. Now there were four old grand ministers of the palace who all wished to marry her, not because of Amaradevi's many accomplishments, but rather, being attracted by her riches. Princess Amaradevi turned down their proposals, and chose instead to marry a fine young man whose name was Mahoseth.",
      "\n",
      "Amaradevi and Mahoseth loved and respected one another. They lived happily together in peace and harmony. But the four grand ministers were very bitter and resentful. Whenever they spoke to Mahoseth, they tried to be as insulting and offensive as they could be. They even started vicious rumors throughout the palace, claiming that Mahoseth Pandide was disloyal to the king. Then they began to whisper to the king himself that the princess' new husband was a dishonest and deceitful young man. The gentle king, who loved his daughter and her husband, urged the ministers to be careful before making such charges. But that only made the ministers more determined to destroy Mahoseth Pandide.",
      "\n",
      "One day, they decided to tell the king that Mahoseth was plotting to kill him and seize the throne. This time, their arguments and false proofs were so convincing that the king believed them. Without even giving his daughter's husband a chance to defend himself, the angry king ordered him to leave the palace, never to return.",
      "\n",
      "The four ruthless ministers congratulated each other and immediately began plotting their next step. \"Of course,\" the first Grand Minister advised, \"we do not know which one of us Amaradevi will marry. We must each ask her, one at a time. Then after she marries one of us, we will all share her riches. For now, she does nothing but grieve for that foolish husband. So we must wait two weeks from today and then we will talk with her about marriage.\"",
      "\n",
      "With her husband banished from the kingdom forever, Amaradevi passed the days in sorrow. She blamed herself for not being able to save him. Each day, she paced back and forth in her palace rooms and re-lived what had happened. She tried to think of a way to prove to the king that Mahoseth had always been loyal and that it was the four ministers who were the real evil plotters.",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks after Mahoseth Pandide was banished, the first Grand Minister came to visit Amaradevi with his proposals of love and marriage. Amaradevi listened to him quietly. She replied, \"Yes, my dear man, I am quite lonesome. Perhaps I could love you and marry you. If you wish to visit with me, why not return later this evening, at seven o'clock?\"",
      "\n",
      "The first Grand Minister was delighted. He bowed and bowed, and promised to return at the appointed time.",
      "\n",
      "During the same morning, Amaradevi was surprised by the visits of the other three ministers. It seemed that almost as soon as one left, another one appeared. They all praised her beauty, professed their love, and begged her to marry them. Amaradevi was polite to all of them. As they left, she invited each one to visit with her that same evening. The second grand minister she told to come at eight o'clock. The third grand minister she told to come at nine o'clock. And the fourth grand minister she told to come at ten.",
      "\n",
      "Now, Amaradevi had been educated not only in music, painting, and the fine art of poetry but also in government, law, the sciences, and engineering construction. Soon after the last grand minister left, Amaradevi summoned her servants to her palace rooms. First she instructed them how to dig a huge pit under the floor of her small back parlor, and how to prevent it from caving in. This she knew how to do from her studies in engineering construction. Next, she told them how to make a special mixture of mud, hot water, and sticky rice in a large caldron. The rice, she knew, would expand and swell when it was mixed for a while with hot water. The servants then poured this mixture into the pit, filling it halfway. Finally, Amaradevi taught the servants how to construct a trap door to cover the large hole. The trap door could be opened by a rope that was secretly hidden behind a curtain.",
      "\n",
      "When the construction work was finished, Amaradevi dismissed the servants and sent for her personal maid. She ordered her maid to bring all of her precious jewels and scatter them about on a table near the trap door in the small back parlor.\u00a0 When that was done, Amaradevi told the maid that she expected the four grand ministers to visit that evening. The maid was to welcome them respectfully and ask them to wait for the princess in the small back parlor. Amaradevi added, \"When each man arrives and is in the small back parlor, please come to me.\"",
      "\n",
      "That evening, promptly at seven o'clock, the first Grand Minister arrived. The maid greeted him politely and led him to the small back parlor. Then she walked softly to her ' rooms, where Princess Amaradevi said, \"Follow me quietly and do as I tell you.\"",
      "\n",
      "The maid followed after Amaradevi to the small back parlor. They slipped silently behind the curtain, waited, and watched. The first Grand Minister was bending over the table of glistening jewels. He put his hand out to touch one.\u00a0 Then he quickly pulled his hand back to his side and stepped back. He paced the room a bit and slowly returned to the table, putting his hand out once more, then down again. The jewels were like magnets, pulling his hands to them. He must have just one. He looked around the room and through the doorway. Then, quickly reaching out, he grabbed a huge ruby and stuffed it deep into his pocket. At that moment, Amaradevi signaled her maid. Both women pulled hard on the rope. The trap door opened, throwing the First Grand Minister screaming into the large pit of warm mud and sticky rice. Then the heavy trap door closed neatly and tightly.",
      "\n",
      "The three other grand ministers arrived at their appointed times. Each one in turn was politely greeted by the maid. Each one in turn was asked to wait for the princess in the small back parlor. And each one in turn became bewitched by the table of shimmering rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. None of them could resist the temptation of stuffing at least one of the jewels into his pocket. As each grand minister stuffed his pocket, the two women pulled the trap-door rope, throwing another false suitor into the deep pit filled with warm mud and sticky rice. As each grand minister was added to the pit, the mud and swelling, sticky rice rose higher and higher.",
      "\n",
      "Amaradevi kept the trap door tightly closed all night. The next morning, she told her servants to take the mud-caked ministers out of the pit, bind their hands, and lead them to the royal court. When they reached the throne room, the princess bowed before her father. \"Your Majesty,\" she said, \"I ask your permission to prove to the royal court the treachery of these four grand ministers of the palace.\"",
      "\n",
      "The king looked surprised, but nodded. Amaradevi continued. \"I refused the proposals of these grand ministers because I knew that they were greedy for my riches. When I married the good Mahoseth, they plotted against him and finally convinced the royal court that he was disloyal and dishonest. Now the ministers have come to me once again with proposals of love and marriage. But still, the only thing that they really love is our royal jewels. I trapped them as they were stealing our sacred treasures from my apartments. I will prove this to you. Now you will know who the guilty traitors really are.\"",
      "\n",
      "Amaradevi signaled her maid. The woman reached into each grand minister's pocket, pulled out a precious royal jewel, and held it up before everyone's eyes.",
      "\n",
      "The king was furious. He ordered the palace guards to tie the mud-caked ministers to elephants for all the people to see.",
      "\n",
      " Amaradevi bowed to the king and returned to her palace rooms. Mahoseth Pandide was summoned from exile, and he speedily returned home to his loving and clever wife, Princess Amaradevi.",

      "O",
      "nce a good king, knowing that he was dying, asked one last favor of his guardian Fairy.",
      "\n",
      "\"Madam,\" said the good King to the Fairy, \"You know I have but one child, my dear Prince Derek. Kindly grant my last favor on my son's behalf.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Say the word,\" answered the Fairy. \"I will make your son the handsomest prince in the world, or the richest, or the most powerful; choose whichever you like for him.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" replied the good King, \"it would do him no good to be rich, or handsome, or to possess all the kingdoms of the world, if he were unhappy. You know very well that only a good man can be really content. Madam, if you promised me to become his friend then I know he would grow to be the best of princes.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I will gladly become his friend,\" answered the Fairy; \"but it is not in my power to make Prince Derek a good man unless he will help me. He must himself try hard to become good. I can only promise to give him good advice, to scold him for his faults, and to punish him if he will not correct and punish himself.\"",
      "\n",
      "The good King was satisfied with this promise. Very soon afterwards he died.",
      "\n",
      "Two days later, after the Prince had gone to bed, the Fairy suddenly appeared to him. She said, \"I promised your father that I would be your friend, and to keep my word I have brought you a present.\" Then she put upon his finger a gold ring.",
      "\n",
      "\"Take great care of this ring,\" she said: \"it is more precious than diamonds. Every time you do a bad deed it will prick your finger. If, in spite of its pricking, you go on in your own evil way, you will lose my friendship, and I shall become your enemy.\"",
      "\n",
      "So saying, the Fairy disappeared, leaving Prince Derek very much astonished.",
      "\n",
      "For some time he behaved so well that the ring never pricked him. His subjects called him Prince Derek the Happy.",
      "\n",
      "One day however, he went out hunting, but could get no sport, which put him in a bad temper. It seemed to him as he rode along that his ring was pressing into his finger, but as it did not prick him he did not heed it. When he got home and went to his own room, his little dog Bibi ran to meet him, jumping round with pleasure. \"Get away!\" snapped the Prince. \"I don't want you now.\"",
      "\n",
      "The poor little dog, who didn't understand this at all, pulled at the prince's waistcoat to make him at least look at her, and this made Prince Derek so cross that he gave her a hard kick.",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the ring pricked him sharply, as if it had been a pin. He was very much surprised, and sat down in a corner of his room.",
      "\n",
      "\"The Fairy must be laughing at me,\" he thought. \"Surely I have done no great wrong in just pushing aside a tiresome animal! What is the good of being ruler, after all, if I am not even allowed to kick my own dog?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not making fun of you,\" said a voice, answering Prince Derek's thoughts. \"You have committed two faults. First of all, you were out of temper because you could not have what you wanted. Then you were cruel to a poor little animal who did not in the least deserve to be ",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you are far above a little dog, but if it were right that great people should ill-treat all who are beneath them, I might at this moment beat you, or kill you, for a fairy is greater than humans. The advantage of possessing a great empire is not to be able to do the evil you desire, but to do all the good you possibly can.\"",
      "\n",
      "The Prince promised to try and do better in the future, but he did not keep his word. In the following weeks and months, his ring pricked him more and more often. It gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault, but when he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed. At last he got tired of being constantly reminded, and wanted to be able to do as he liked, so he threw his ring under his bed. Then he thought himself the happiest of men to have gotten rid of its pricks. He gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him, till he became quite wicked and nobody liked him any longer.",
      "\n",
      "One day, when the Prince was walking about, he noticed a young girl who was so very attractive that he made up his mind at once that he must marry her. Her name was Celia, and she was as good inside as she was beautiful.",
      "\n",
      "Prince Derek believed Celia would be delighted at the prospect of becoming queen, but she said, \"Sire, I may be a shepherdess and a poor girl, but even if I were a princess, I would not marry you.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What? Do you dislike me?\" asked the Prince, who was very much vexed at this answer.",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my Prince,\" replied Celia. \"Up until recently I very much admired you. But what good would riches be to me, and all the grand dresses and splendid carriages that you would give me, if the bad deeds which you now do every day made me hate and despise you?\"",
      "\n",
      "The Prince was very angry at this speech, and commanded his officers to make Celia a prisoner at once and carry her off to his palace. All day long the remembrance of what she had said annoyed him, but as he loved her he could not make up his mind how punish her. Still, thinking of how she had laughed at his love nagged at him so much that he found himself worked up to a furious rage. He rushed off to find her, declaring that if she refused to marry him one moment longer she would be sold as a slave the very next day.",
      "\n",
      "But when he reached the room in which Celia had been locked up, he was greatly surprised to find that she was not in it, though he had had the key in his own pocket all the time. His anger was terrible, and he vowed vengeance against whoever had helped her escape. After making this proclamation he dashed to his own room, but he had scarcely got into it when there was a clap of thunder which made the ground shake, and the Fairy suddenly appeared before him.",
      "\n",
      "\"I promised your father,\" she said sternly, \"to give you good advice, and to punish you if you refused to follow it. You have despised my counsel. You have gone your own evil way until you are only outwardly a man; really you are a monster. It is time that I fulfill my promise, and begin your punishment. I condemn you to resemble the animals whose ways you have imitated. Like the lion, you frighten the innocent with your angry roars. Like the wolf, you greedily take whatever you want. Like the snake, you betray any friend to suit your own purposes. Like the bull, you are bad-tempered. Therefore, in your new form, you will resemble all these animals.\"",
      "\n",
      "The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Derek found himself in a great forest, beside a clear lake, in which he could plainly see the horrible creature he had become. He had a lion's head, a bull's horns, a wolf's feet, and a snake's body. A voice said to him:",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold the state which your wickedness has brought you.\"",
      "\n",
      "Prince Derek recognized the voice of the Fairy. He turned in fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could; but he saw no one.",
      "\n",
      "The Prince thought the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could. At least then he would not be continually reminded of his ugliness. So he ran toward the woods, but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears.\u00a0 Hunters hiding in a tree leapt down and secured him with several chains. Seeing that he was a rare beast, the hunters led him into the chief city of his own kingdom to be displayed in a cage as a curiosity.",
      "\n",
      "All the while, he furiously bit and tore at his chains, blaming the Fairy as the cause of all his misfortunes.",
      "\n",
      "As they approached the town he saw that great rejoicing was being held. The hunters were told that the Prince, whose only pleasure it was to torment his people, had been found in his room, killed by a thunder-bolt (for that is what was supposed to have become of him). The people had offered the crown to the former tutor of the Prince, a faithful nobleman whose name was Agalthorpe. Agalthorpe had tutored the Prince since he had been a child, and had loved the Prince as if he had been his own son. This noble lord had just been crowned king, and his rise to the throne was the cause of the rejoicing. \"For,\" they said, \"Agalthorpe is well-known as a good and just man, and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity.\"",
      "\n",
      "Prince Derek roared with anger when he heard this, but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace. There he saw Agalthorpe seated upon a magnificent throne, and all the people crowded round, cheering and wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor.",
      "\n",
      "Presently Agalthorpe made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent. He said, \"I accept the crown you have offered me, but only that I may keep it for Prince Derek, who is not dead as you suppose. A certain Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again, as good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne. Alas!\" he continued, \"We may hate his faults, but let us pity him and hope for his restoration. As for me, I would die gladly if that could bring back our Prince to reign justly and worthily once more.\"",
      "\n",
      "These words went straight to Prince Derek's heart. He realized the true affection and faithfulness of his old tutor, and for the first time reproached himself for all his evil deeds. At the same instant he felt his anger melting away, and began quietly to think over his past life. He stopped tearing and biting at his chains.",
      "\n",
      "The hunters took him to a great menagerie, where he was caged along with other wild beasts. Nevertheless, he was determined to show his sorrow for his past bad behavior by being gentle and obedient to the man who had to take care of him. One day, when his keeper was asleep, a tiger broke its chains and flew at the keeper to eat him up.",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could save that man's life,\" the Prince said to himself. He had hardly wished this when his iron cage flew open, and he rushed to the side of the keeper, who was hopelessly defending himself against the tiger. When the keeper saw the monster also rushing toward him he gave himself up for lost, but the monster threw itself upon the tiger, chased it back into its cage, secured the door, and then came and crouched at the keeper's feet.",
      "\n",
      "The keeper stooped to caress the strange creature which had done him such a great service. At the same instant the monster disappeared, and the keeper saw at his feet a playful little dog!",
      "\nPrince Derek, delighted by the change, frisked about the keeper, showing his joy in every way he could. The keeper, scooping the dog up in his arms, carried him to the King Agalthorpe, the former tutor of the missing prince.",
      "\n",
      "King Agalthorpe's wife, the Queen, said she would like to keep this wonderful little dog. The Prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have forgotten that he would have been king himself. The Queen petted and took care of him, but she was so afraid that he would get fat that she consulted the court physician, who said that he was to be fed only bread, and not even much even of that. So poor",
      "\n",
      "Prince Derek was terribly hungry all day long, but he was patient about it.",
      "\nOne day, when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast, he thought he would like to eat it out in the garden, so he took it up in his mouth and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the palace.\u00a0 There Prince Derek noticed a young girl who was trying to eat a few blades of grass -- she was so hungry. He said to himself,",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very hungry, but I shall not die of starvation before I get my dinner. If I give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps I may save her life.\"",
      "\n",
      "So he laid his piece of bread in the girl's hand, and she eagerly ate it up.",
      "\n",
      "She soon seemed quite well again, and the Prince, delighted to have been able to help her, was thinking of going home to the palace, when he heard a great outcry, and turning around saw Celia, who was being carried against her will into the great house.",
      "\n",
      "For the first time the Prince regretted he was no longer the monster, for if he were, then he would have been able to charge toward her captors, and rescue Celia. Now he could only bark feebly at the people who were carrying her off, and try to follow them, but they chased and kicked him away.",
      "\n",
      "He determined not to quit the palace till he knew what had become of Celia.",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" he said to himself. \"I am furious with the people who are carrying Celia off, but wasn't I the one who made her a prisoner in the first place, and wasn't I the one who intended to sell her as a slave?\"",
      "\n",
      "And the Prince found himself changed at that moment into a beautiful white dove. He remembered that white was the favorite color of the Fairy, and began to hope that he might at last win back her favor.\u00a0 But just now his first care was for Celia. Rising into the air, he flew round and round the house until he saw an open window. He searched every room, but in vain. No trace of Celia was to be seen. The Prince, in despair, determined to search the world till he found her. He flew on and on for several days, until he came to a great desert, where he saw a cavern. To his delight there sat Celia, sharing a simple breakfast with an old hermit.",
      "\n",
      "Overjoyed to have found her, Prince Derek perched on her shoulder, trying to express by his chirpings and wing caresses how glad he was to see her again. Celia, surprised and delighted by the tameness of the white dove, stroked it softly and said, though she never thought it would understand her:",
      "\n",
      "\"I accept the gift that you make me of yourself - and I will love you always.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care what you are saying, Celia,\" said the old hermit. \"Are you prepared to keep that promise?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I hope so, my sweet shepherdess,\" cried the Prince, who at that very moment was restored to his natural shape. \"You just now said that you would love me always. Tell me that you really mean what you said, or I shall have to ask the Fairy to give me back the form of the dove which pleased you so much.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"You need not be afraid that she will change her mind,\" said the Fairy, throwing off the hermit's robe in which she had been disguised, and appearing before them.",
      "\n",
      "\"Celia has loved you every since she first saw you, only she would not tell you while you became so obstinate and naughty. Now that you have repented and mean to be good, you deserve to be happy, and so now she may love you as much as she likes.\"",
      "\n",
      "Celia and Prince Derek threw themselves at the Fairy's feet, and the Prince never tired of thanking her for her kindness. Celia was delighted to hear how sorry he was for all his past follies and misdeeds, and promised to love him as long as she lived.",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise, my children,\" said the Fairy, \"and I will transport you back to the palace. Prince Derek shall have back again the crown he forfeited for his bad behavior.\"",
      "\n",
      "While she was speaking they found themselves in Agalthorpe's hall, and his delight was great at seeing his dear master once more. Agalthorpe joyfully gave up the throne to the Prince, and remained always the most faithful of his subjects.",
      "\n",
      "Celia and Prince Derek reigned for many years. The Prince was so determined to govern worthily and to do his duty that his ring, which he located under his bed and put back on his finger, never once severely pricked him again.",
      "\n",

      "IN THE SHORES\u00a0of a wide bay on the Atlantic coast of what is now called Canada there dwelt in old times a great Native American warrior known for his wondrous deeds. He had a very wonderful and strange power - he could make himself invisible. In this way he could mingle unseen with his enemies and listen to their plots. He was known among the people as Strong Wind, the Invisible.",

      "Strong Wind dwelt with his sister in a tent near the sea, and his sister helped him greatly in his work. Many maidens would have been glad to marry him, and he was much sought after because of his mighty deeds. It was known that Strong Wind would marry the first maiden who could see him as he came home at night. Many made the trial, but it was a long time before one succeeded.",
      "\n",
      "Strong Wind used a clever trick to test the truthfulness of all who sought to win him. Each evening as the sun went down, his sister walked on the beach with any girl who wished to make the trial. His sister could always see Strong Wind, but no one else could because he made himself invisible to all but her. And as he came home from work, his sister would see him drawing near, and she would ask the girl who sought him, \"Do you see him? Do you see my brother?\" And each girl could not see him but wanted to win the hand of Strong Wind, and so would falsely answer, \"Yes.\" His sister would then ask, \"With what does he draw his sled?\" And each girl would answer, \"With the hide of a moose,\" or \"With a pole,\" or \"With a great cord.\" And then his sister would know that they all had lied, and their answers were mere guesses. Many tried and lied and failed, for Strong Wind would not marry anyone who was untruthful.",
      "\n",
      "There lived in the village a great chief who had three daughters. Their mother had long been dead. One of these was much younger than the others. She was very beautiful and gentle and well beloved by all, and for that reason her older sisters were very jealous of her charms and treated her cruelly. They clothed her in rags so she would look ugly, and they cut off her long black hair, and they burned her face with coals from the fire so that her skin would become scarred and disfigured.\u00a0 And they lied to their father, the chief, telling him that she had done these things to herself. But the young girl was patient and kept her gentle heart and went about her work.",

      "Like other girls, the chief's two eldest daughters wanted to marry Strong Wind. One evening, as the sun went down, the oldest daughter walked on the shore with Strong Wind's sister and waited for his coming. Soon he came home from his day's work, drawing his sled. His sister asked as usual, \"Do you see him? Do you see my brother?\" And the oldest daughter, lying, answered, \"Yes.\" And she asked, \"Of what is his shoulder strap made?\" The girl, guessing, said, \"Of rawhide.\" And Strong Wind knew that the oldest daughter had lied, and he kept himself from her sight, and she went home dismayed.",
      "\n",
      "The second daughter, too, tried to win Strong Wind. She walked along the shore with Strong Wind's sister, and when the sister asked her if she saw Strong Wind she, too, lied, saying, \"Yes\". When she was asked of what his shoulder strap was made, she guessed, \"Of woven grasses.\" And so she was also denied by Strong Wind.",
      "\n",
      "One day the chief's youngest daughter with her rags and her burnt face resolved to seek Strong Wind. She patched her clothes with bits of birch bark from the trees as best she could, and put on the few little ornaments she possessed, and went forth to try to see the Invisible One as all the other girls of the village had done before. Her sisters laughed at her and called her a fool. As she passed along the road, all the people laughed because of her tattered frock and her burnt face, but silently she went her way.",

And his sister asked, \"Do you see him?\" The girl could not, and she answered, \"No.\" His sister wondered greatly because she was the first one who had spoken the truth. She asked, \"Do you see him now?\" And the girl answered, \"Yes, and he is very wonderful.\" Then the sister asked, \"With what does he draw his sled?\" The girl answered, \"With the Rainbow,\" and she was much afraid. And the sister asked further, \"Of what is his bowstring?\" And the girl answered, \"His bowstring is the Milky Way.\"",
      "\n",
      "Then Strong Wind's sister knew that because the girl had spoken the truth, her brother had made himself visible to her. She said, \"Truly, you have seen him.\"",
      "\n",
      "And she took the girl home and bathed her, and all the scars disappeared from her face and body; and her hair grew long and black again like the raven's wing; and she gave her fine clothes to wear and many rich ornaments. Then she bade her to take the wife's seat in the tent. Soon Strong Wind entered and sat beside her, and called her his bride.",

But Strong Wind, who knew of their cruelty, resolved to punish them. Using his great power, he changed them both into aspen trees and rooted them into the earth. Since that day the leaves of the aspen have always trembled, and they shiver in fear at the approach of Strong Wind, it matters not how softly he comes, for they are still mindful of his great power and anger because of their lies and their cruelty to their sister long ago.",

      "LONG AGO",
      ", a king and queen ruled a large and powerful land that is now known as Iceland. Their two children, Prince Sigurd and Princess Sophia, were beloved throughout the land. ",
      "There was only a year between the brother and sister, and they loved each other so much that there was little they did without the other nearby.",
      "\n",
      "For many years all was well. Then one day their mother, the queen, fell ill and died.",
      "\n",
      "For quite a long time, the king was so bowed down with grief that he barely sat on the throne to run the kingdom. At last his Prime Minister shared with him that the people were starting to grumble.\u00a0 They needed their king to rule as a king should, to settle matters and to make peace.",
      "\n",
      "\"Ruling the kingdom without my dear wife at my side will not be easy,\" sighed the king. ",
      "\n",
      "\"Sire, if I may,\" said the Prime Minister, \"there's something else.\u00a0 People are also saying it would be best for Your Majesty to remarry as soon as possible, for the good of the kingdom, that is.\" ",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said the king.\u00a0 \"I know what you say is true, though it may be hard to bear. Very well, then.\u00a0 Go.\u00a0 I command you to seek a lady from far and wide who's fit to share my throne.\"",
      "\n",
      "So the Prime Minister assembled a group of the king's attendants to visit the royal courts of the world and seek such a lady. But the ship that carried them had been gone only a few days when a thick fog came on.\u00a0 For a whole month, the ship drifted about in darkness.\u00a0 At last the fog lifted.\u00a0 Before them appeared a rocky island. The crew did not know where they were, but at any rate they were grateful to see land.\u00a0 Perhaps there was fruit and water once they went ashore.",
      "\n",
      "Taking a small rowboat, the Prime Minister rowed to shore to explore, and find out if the island was safe.",
      "\n",
      "He had just stepped onto sand when he heard music. Turning toward the sound, he saw an enchanting woman and a girl beside her, who was playing on a harp and singing a sad tune. The minister greeted the lady politely, and nodded to the girl.\u00a0 The lady replied in a friendly way.\u00a0 She asked why he had come to such an out-of-the-way place. He told her about the king and how he had lost his wife.",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I have the same situation as your master,\" said the lady. \"I was once married to a mighty king who ruled over this land, until the sad day when pirates came.\u00a0 They killed my husband and put all of our people to death. My daughter and I were able to escape and hide, and that's how we were able to survive.\"",
      "\n",
      "The daughter whispered, \"Mother, are you speaking the truth?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush!\" the mother angrily whispered back.\u00a0 She twisted the girl's cheek in a quick gesture the Prime Minister did not see.",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your name, madam?\" asked the Prime Minister.",
      "\n",
      "\"Helga,\" replied the enchanting lady, turning back toward him. \"And this is Agna, my daughter.\" After this, the lady and the Prime Minister talked of many things. He was so impressed by her charm and appeal that he soon persuaded her to return with him on his ship, to marry the king.",
      "\n",
      "As the Prime Minister looked back from the ship to the shoreline, he could tell the rocky island was completely barren and deserted, not fit for anyone to live in.\u00a0 But of that he did not care, nor did anyone else on the ship if they happened to look back, too.\u00a0 At least, they all felt, they could return home at last.",
      "\n",
      "The winds were favorable and the crew enjoyed a speedy voyage. On arriving back home, the Prime Minister sent a messenger to run ahead to the capital and inform the king of the success of his voyage.",
      "\n",
      "When His Majesty's eyes fell on the mother and daughter, both clad in dresses of silver and gold, he forgot his sorrows.\u00a0 At once, he ordered preparations for a wedding to the lady to take place at once.",
      "\n",
      "After the marriage, things were different.\u00a0 The king's new wife had to be consulted on all matters. She attended all council meetings, and her opinion was the one that mattered in deciding issues of peace or war. T",
      "he king did not notice something that other members at court, with alarm, had started to see.\u00a0 Whenever anyone disagreed with the new queen, that person soon disappeared without a trace.\u00a0 Soon, members of the court kept a careful distance from the new queen. The king's two children, Sigurd and Sophia, saw all of this, too.\u00a0 They also kept a safe distance from their new stepmother.",
      "\n",
      "One day, the queen insisted to her husband that his two children must move out of the castle. The king felt he must go along with her wish, though he arranged that their new house was comfortable and luxurious, with servants and carriages and anything they could possibly want.",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterward, his wife said to the king that it was time for him to tour his kingdom and see that his governors were not cheating him of the money that was his due.\u00a0 ",
      "\"And you need not worry about leaving the castle,\" she added, \"for I will rule the country while you are away as carefully as you would yourself.\"",
      "\n",
      "The king felt uneasy, nevertheless he set about his preparations. The night before he was to leave, he went to his children's home to say good-bye to his son and daughter.",
      "\n",
      "They rushed into his arms, for they loved him dearly. After catching up with news and stories of the day, he said, \"Listen to me carefully. There is something important I must tell you. If I should never come back from this journey, I fear it may not be safe for you to stay here.\"\u00a0 The children were surprised their father should say such a thing.\u00a0 Yet with everything lately that had been going on, they felt it was best to keep quiet, and listen.\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "\"If you learn that I have died,\" the father continued in a warning tone, \"you must leave here right away. Take the road going east till it leads you to a mountain.\u00a0 Cross over the mountain, circle around a bay, and then look carefully for a grove of trees and for two special trees - one that's entirely blue and the other red, so you cannot miss them. These trees are magical. Each of you can hide inside the trunks of the trees.\u00a0 They will keep you safe until the danger has passed.\"",
      "\n",
      "With these words, the king kissed them goodbye.\u00a0 He boarded ship and after a few days, the wind suddenly picked up.\u00a0 Soon came a fearful storm of thunder and lightning. In spite of the efforts of the frightened sailors, the ship was driven onto the rocks. Not a man on board was saved.",
      "\n",
      "That same night, Prince Sigurd and Princess Sophia had the very same dream.\u00a0 They dreamt their father appeared before them in clothes dripping wet. Taking the crown from his head, his father set it down on the ground, and then he disappeared.",
      "\n",
      "The brother and sister agreed the dream meant that their father must be dead.\u00a0 They must lose no time in obeying his orders and fleeing to safety. So they collected their jewels and a few clothes, and left their house.",
      "\n",
      "They took the road east until they arrived at the mountain.\u00a0 Prince Sigurd glanced around.\u00a0 Behind him, he saw their stepmother was following them in pursuit, with an expression on her face that made her more fearsome than the scariest old witch. He and his sister hurried on over the mountain and around the bay.\u00a0 They reached a grove with the two unusual trees which they recognized right away - one red and the other blue. Quickly, each jumped into one of the tree trunks, and once inside, they felt safe and protected. Unable to find the children, Queen Helga returned to the castle.",
      "\n",
      "Now at the same time, there ruled in the faraway country of Greece a king who was very rich and powerful. He had one son, young Prince Leo, who was the pride of his father's heart.",
      "\n",
      "Now Prince Leo had heard reports of the charms and many accomplishments of Princess Sophia of Iceland.\u00a0 He determined to seek her out and to ask for her hand in marriage. By her black arts, Queen Helga learned of his voyage to her land. When Prince Leo of Greece arrived at port, she dressed her daughter Agna in a splendid gown and prepared the court to greet the visiting prince.",
      "\n",
      "When he arrived at the palace, Prince Leo was brought to the Queen.\u00a0 After the usual greetings, he asked to see the famous Princess Sophia, admired for her grace and skills.\u00a0 The Queen brought forward her daughter, Agna.",
      "\n",
      "The Prince looked at her and was rather disappointed. There seemed to be something missing in the expression on her face.",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you must not wonder at her pale face and heavy eyes,\" said the Queen hastily, for she saw what was passing in his mind. \"She has never gotten over the loss of two fathers - first her own father, and now, my husband.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"That shows a good heart,\" thought the Prince, \"and when she is happy her natural zest will come back, no doubt.\" So without further delay he begged the Queen to agree to their engagement, for the marriage must take place in his own country of Greece.",
      "\n",
      "The Queen was delighted. She had hardly expected to succeed so soon. At once, she set about preparing Agna for her journey.",
      "\n",
      "Prince Leo and Agna set sail in a splendid ship headed back to Greece. In a short time, however, a dense fog settled over the ship. In the dark, the captain somehow steered to a bay. As the fog lifted, the Prince noticed two beautiful and strange trees, one red and the other blue.\u00a0 As you can imagine they were quite different from any trees that grew back home in Greece!",
      "\n",
      "Eager to bring back such rare treasures, the Prince bade his sailors to cut down the two trees and carry them on board. And so Sigurd and Sophia, hidden inside the two tree trunks, were carried onto the ship. Then the ship sailed on to Greece.",
      "\n",
      "The king and queen of Greece met their son and his intended bride on the steps of their palace.\u00a0 They led the girl to the women's house, where she would have to stay till her wedding day. The Prince ordered that the two unusual blue and red trees should be brought into the drawing room of his castle.",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, Prince Leo called for his attendants to bring his future bride to the drawing room. When she came, he said to her, \"All the world knows of your exceptional skill at weaving, Princess Sophia.\"\u00a0 For as you'll remember, he thought Agna was Princess Sophia. \"Here is plenty of silk yarn and a loom.\u00a0 You are to weave two gowns, one blue and the other red, and a green robe as well.\"",
      "\n",
      "Left alone, Agna burst into tears. She thought that everything would be discovered, for Princess Sophia's skill in weaving was known far and wide, and she didn't know the first thing about weaving. As Agna sat with her face hidden and with sobs overtaking her, the Prince Sigurd, hidden inside his tree trunk, heard her wails.",
      "\n",
      "\"Sophie, my sister,\" he called out softly, \"Agna is weeping.\u00a0 Help her.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" said Sophia from inside her tree trunk. \"Have you forgotten the wrongs her mother did to us?\u00a0 Thanks to her and her mother we were thrown out of our own castle.\u00a0 After that, we had to escape for our lives!\"",
      "\n",
      "But she was not really so unforgiving, and very soon Sophia slid quietly out of the tree trunk. Taking the blue skeins of silk to the loom, Sophia sat and began to weave. Much surprised was Agna to see her stepsister there in the room, you can be sure!\u00a0 Soon the blue silk gown was not only woven but embroidered, too. Sophia slipped back safe inside her tree trunk before the Prince returned.",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, this is the most beautiful work I have ever seen!\" said he. \"And I look forward to seeing the red one next.\u00a0 It'll be even better because the thread is even more fine.\" With a low bow he left the room.",
      "\n",
      "Agna had secretly hoped that when the Prince had seen the blue gown finished he would have be so impressed, he would have released her from having to weave the others.\u00a0 But when she found she was expected to weave the second gown, too, her heart sank.\u00a0 She began to loudly moan and groan. Again Sigurd heard Agna's cries and urged Sophia to come to her aid. Sophia, feeling sorry for her distress, wove and embroidered the second gown as she had done the first, mixing gold thread and precious stones along the collar, down the sleeves, and along the bottom where the gown would sweep the floor. When it was done, she glided back into her tree trunk just moments before the Prince stepped into the room.",

The last one is a robe, my dear, and it will be the very green robe I will wear on our wedding day.\" He expected the princess would be pleased, but in her face he saw only gloom and despair .\u00a0 \"Take three days to finish it,\" he said, thinking that might relieve the dread he saw in her eyes.\u00a0 \"It will be the best yet, no doubt!\" he said, and trying to sound as cheerful as he could, he added. \"I will wear it on our wedding day.\"\u00a0 With a short bow, he left.",

      "Agna sank into a chair and tears overcame her once again. She remembered all the unkind things that she and her mother had done.\u00a0 After all, she had said nothing when her mother had forced Sophia and her brother to move out the castle. She was marrying the Prince of Greece only because he believed that SHE was",
      "\u00a0",
      "Princess Sophia. Could she hope now that Sophia would come to her rescue yet a third time? Sophia had already helped Agna twice, and was thinking she might let Agna get on as best she could this third time by herself.\u00a0 Yet her brother Sigurd begged his sister to help just one more time, and the tears of poor Agna pulled at Sophia's heart.\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "So Sophia again slid out of her tree trunk and set to work, to Agna's great relief. Sophia wove that shining green silk into a pattern such as no one had ever seen before. But it took a long time.\u00a0 On the third morning, just as she was putting the last stitches into the last flower, the door opened.",
      "\n",
      "Quickly, Sophia jumped up.\u00a0 She tried to slip back into her tree trunk in time, but the folds of the silk were wrapped around her and she tripped.\u00a0 She would have fallen to the floor if the prince of Greece had not caught her in his arms.",
      "\n",
      "\"What's this?\" he said, as the real Princess Sophia pulled back and righted herself.\u00a0 Looking at both women, he said, \"I've thought for some time that something was amiss around here.\"\u00a0 And to Sophia, \"Tell me, who are you?\"\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "So Sophia told the prince who she really was, and the story of how it came about that she and her brother had to flee from their home. Before the Prince Leo could ask the whereabouts of the missing brother, it struck him that he had been deceived by Agna.\u00a0 He angrily turned to her and declared that by posing as she did to and deceiving him, she could face death!",
      "\n",
      "But Agna fell at his feet and begged for mercy. It was her mother's doing, she said. \"It was she and not I, who passed me off as Princess Sophia.\" In fact, Agna knew more than she was saying about Helga, but none of the others knew what she did, and who would believe her anyway?",
      "\n",
      "\"Look,\" said Princess Sophia to the Prince of Greece, \"The only lie she ever told you about was the gowns and the robe, and",
      "\u00a0does she really deserve death for that?\"",
      "\n",
      "Prince Leo was struck by the compassion and wisdom shown by this maiden, the real Princess Sophia.\u00a0 At that moment Prince Sigurd stepped out of his tree trunk, too.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"There you are!\" exclaimed Prince Leo.\u00a0 \u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Prince Sigurd echoed what his sister had said, and also appealed to Prince Leo to forgive Agna.\u00a0 With the two of them urging him to forgive her, he relented.\u00a0 And perhaps, he thought, this was just one of those misunderstandings that sometimes happens.\u00a0 Agna stood up.",
      " Now it was Princess Sophia who was impressed by the Prince of Greece for his generous spirit.",
      "\n",
      "Then Prince Leo went down on one knee. He asked Princess Sophia if she would consent to become his bride.",

      "\n",
      "Sophia was pleased, but shook her head. \"Not until my stepmother is stripped of her powers and banished from our land,\" said she.\u00a0 \"Until then, she will not stop bringing misery upon us all.\"\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "\"But what can we do?\" said her brother.",
      "\n",
      "That was when Agna told them all the whole truth about Helga.\u00a0 She not her real mother after all.\u00a0 In fact, she was an ogre who had stolen Agna from a neighboring palace where she had been working as a lady in waiting. Besides being an ogre, Helga was also a witch. Agna had been terrified of all the terrible things her false mother might do if she didn't go along with what she wanted. Using her black arts, it was Helga who had pulled the Prime Minister's ship to their rocky island when he and his crew were seeking a bride for the king. It was Helga who had sunk the ship in which Sigurd and Sophia's father, the king, had set sail. And it was Helga who had caused the strange disappearances of the palace attendants who disagreed with her, for which no one could account, by eating them during the night. The evil woman hoped to get rid of all the people in the country and then fill the land with ogres like herself. It was only through the black arts, Agna told them, that Helga could be defeated.",
      "\n",
      "The Prince of Greece summoned a wizard skilled in artful magic. He then gathered an army. Prince Leo, Prince Siguard, the wizard and the army all set sail to Iceland, where they marched on the town where the false Queen Helga ruled. The army came so suddenly that Helga was easily captured.\u00a0 Then the wizard saw to it that Helga's powers and strength were stripped away. She was set sail to a distant island, and no one ever heard from her again. The two princes, the wizard and the army returned to Greece.",
      "\n",
      "Princess Sophia no longer had any reason for putting off her wedding to the Prince of Greece, nor did she wish to. The two of them were married, and Agna became Sophia's most trusted lady in waiting.\u00a0 Prince Sigurd returned to his homeland to rule, while Princess Sophia remained in Greece to rule with her new husband. ",
      "\n",
      "Over the years the brother and sister stayed close in touch, visiting each another as often as they could.\u00a0 In time Prince Siguard also married.\u00a0 And they all lived happily ever after.",

      "\n",
      "By the time the prince drew near to the ground, it had become dark. Spotting a rooftop higher than all the others, he landed the horse upon it and dismounted. Hungry and tired, he searched about and found that he was on the roof of some large building. At last he came to some steps. Climbing down the steps, he found a door and through the door he saw a light. A number of guards were asleep on pallets with their swords lying beside them. This, along with the fact that this was the highest rooftop in the land, convinced the Prince that he must be in the palace of the land. He knew that if any of the guards awakened he would be in great danger. So he quietly climbed the steps back to the roof, and decided to sleep for the night in a dark corner. Before dawn, he would leave on his magic horse before anyone awoke.",
      "\n",
      "But a princess had already been awakened by the sounds she heard on the roof. She instructed her guards to find out what had alighted and to bring the trespasser to her at once. The guards roughly brought the prince before her, and he fell on his knees.",

      "\"Forgive me, princess, for awakening you,\" he said. \"I am the son of a king, and one who has taken an entirely unexpected adventure, the particulars of which I would be happy to relate to you, if you would allow me.\"",
      "\n",
      "The lady was none other than Princess Nadia, the daughter of the King of Bengal, a region in northern India of today. Many of her attendants by this time were also awakened. The princess told Darius she would be glad to hear all about his adventure in the morning, but for the present asked him to withdraw. She ordered her attendants to conduct him to a bedchamber, and to supply him with food and refreshments.",
      "\n",
      "The next day, Prince Darius remained a guest of Princess Nadia. Over the next few days the two of them got to know each other, and before long before they fell in love.",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon the prince said to her, \"Ah, my princess, everything seems different now. I was thinking about that scoundrel who tried to trick his way into my royal family. He was a no-good louse to be sure, but he may be in prison or even executed on my account, when I know that I was the one who jumped on that horse before he had a chance to show me how it works.\"",
      "\n",
      "The princess said, \"Are you thinking of going back now?\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you come?\" he asked. She was glad to agree.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the princess left a note so none would worry.\u00a0 And at daybreak they went to the roof where the horse still remained. Prince Darius helped Princess Nadia to alight. Turning the peg, they were out of sight before any attendants in the palace were stirring. In thirty minutes the prince had arrived at the capital of Persia.",
      "\n",
      "He steered the magic horse to land at the prison. As the prince had thought, the stranger was imprisoned there.\u00a0 And he was nearly beside himself since his execution was scheduled to take place the very next morning. Determined to see his father at once about the matter, the prince first took the princess on his magic horse to a cottage in the woods not far from the palace.",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay here while I go to see my father,\" he said to her. \"I'll show him that I'm well, and urge him to hold the execution of the fellow who brought the magic horse. Most of all, I want to tell my father about you. I'm sure he'll prepare a suitable reception at the palace to welcome a princess.\"",
      "\n",
      "He explained to her how to operate the magic horse, in case she might need to flee for safety while he was away.",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, danger was lurking even as they spoke. A thief behind the bushes had overheard their conversation, all of it. \"What luck!\" he thought with glee, \"a princess alone AND",
      "\u00a0",
      "a magic horse! I'll take her to the Sultan of Cashmere.\u00a0 He's made it known far and wide he is seeking a bride.\u00a0 What a fine reward I'll get for her!\"",
      "\n",
      "The thief waited for the Prince to disappear into the woods.\u00a0 Then he sprang on the princess, mounted the magic horse, and held her securely in front of him. Overjoyed at how easy it all was, he turned the peg exactly how he had seen the prince show the princess to do it, and the horse immediately rose into the air. Astonished was the prince on the ground to hear the alarmed cries of his lady love, circling overhead, as the magic horse dipped and dove from inexperienced hands, and he could do nothing about it. He cursed the kidnapper with a thousand curses.",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "While the king was overjoyed to see his son, and at his request ordered a stay of execution for the seller of the horse, he understood why his son must leave again so quickly. The prince put on the clothing of a beggar and determined never to return till he had found his princess again.",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan of Cashmere, in the meantime, was very impressed with the Princess of Bengal. Her distress at her kidnapping only added to her natural beauty, or so his evil mind thought. The Sultan delivered the promised reward and then escorted the princess to his palace. He directed his attendants to bring the magic horse on which they had arrived to the royal treasure for safe-keeping.",
      "\n",
      "The princess hoped the Sultan of Cashmere would prove honorable and reasonable, and would return her to her beloved prince of Persia, but she was much disappointed. In fact, the next morning she was awakened early by the sound of trumpets and the beating of drums, which echoed through the palace and city. When she asked the cause of this rejoicing, she was told it was to celebrate her marriage with their Sultan, which was to take place later that day.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "She rose and dressed herself carelessly, and in her whole behavior appeared to be disordered and wild. The Sultan was soon told of this strange development. When he came to visit her, she put on the appearance of frenzy, flew at him in a rage, and this she did every time he came into the room. The Sultan was much disturbed, and offered large rewards to any doctor who could cure her.\u00a0 But whenever any doctors approached, the princess would fly at them too and beat her fists, so that all began to lose hope for her recovery.",
      "\n",
      "During this time, Prince Darius, disguised as a wandering beggar, had been traveling through many provinces, full of grief, and uncertain which way to go to find his beloved princess. With nearly all hope gone, he rested on a rock. Then who should happen to pass before him but the very stranger who had brought the magical horse to the New Year's feast, more tattered looking than ever, yet glad indeed to have been released from prison.",

      "\"And where, may I ask, is the magic horse?\" he said to the prince. \"Has it proved as unpredictable an item for you as it did to me?\"",
      "\n",
      "The two sat and shared their troubles. In the way of telling tales, the scruffy man related a story of a princess from Bengal who had become mad on the day of her wedding to the Sultan of Cashmere. As he described the circumstances, a flicker of hope lit the prince's heart. Could this princess of Bengal be the same lost love he sought?\u00a0 He was determined to find out.",
      "\n",
      "Arriving at the capital city of Cashmere, he put on the clothes of a doctor. Presenting himself before the Sultan, he claimed that he could cure the princess.",
      "\n",
      "\"First,\" said the pretend doctor, \"I must see her where she cannot see me.\" So he was led into a closet, where he could watch her through a hole in the door. She was carelessly singing a song, in which she wailed of her unhappy fate.",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" he thought, trying to contain his excitement. \"It is my bride!\"",
      "\n",
      "Prince Darius as the doctor told the Sultan that indeed the princess could be cured, but he would need to speak with her alone.",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan agreed. As soon as the prince entered her room, she began to rave at him in her usual furious manner, at which point he held her wrists and whispered urgently, \"I am Darius, your beloved.\"",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The princess stopped raving at once.\u00a0 The attendants withdrew, delighted at this proof of the doctor's abilities. In more whispers, the prince shared a plan with her. Then he returned to the Sultan. The pretend doctor shook his head and said, \"All depends upon a mere chance. You see, the princess, a few hours before she was taken ill, must have touched something enchanted. Unless I can obtain that something, whatever it was, I cannot cure her.\"",
      "\n",
      "The Sultan of Cashmere remembered the magic horse, which was still kept in his treasury. He called for it to be brought to him and showed it to the imaginary doctor. On seeing the horse, the young man said, very gravely, \"I congratulate Your Majesty. This indeed is the very magic object that enchanted the princess. Let this horse be brought out into the great square before the palace, and let the princess be there. I promise that in a few minutes she will be perfectly cured.\"",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the following morning the magic horse was placed in the middle of the square.\u00a0 The supposed doctor drew a large circle around it. He placed around the circle chafing dishes, with a little fire in each. The sultan, with all his nobles and ministers of state, watched with great interest.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The princess was brought out with her head covered in veils, and led to the middle of the circle. The pretend doctor placed her upon the enchanted horse. He then went round to each chafing dish and threw in a certain powder, which soon raised such a cloud of smoke that neither the physician, the princess, nor the magic horse could be seen through it. At that instant the prince of Persia mounted the horse himself. Turning the peg, the magic horse rose into the air.\u00a0",

      "\n",
      "And the prince called down: \"A bride's heart must be earned, it cannot be purchased!\"",
      "\n",
      "That same day the Prince of Persia and his beloved Princess arrived safely at the Persian court. The father rejoiced at the son's return, and immediately ordered a wedding celebration with the greatest splendor that had ever been seen in that land.\u00a0 And so the Prince and Princess lived together, happily ever after.",

      "Many years ago in the Andes Mountains there lived a cold-eyed witch. All through the summer she slept.\u00a0 But at the first snowfall she awoke, full of glee. For winter was her hunting time and her eating time. By some strange magic she was able to draw children to her one by one, and how she did it no one knew. But the truth is that she had a magic ball, a ball bright and shining and of many colors, and this she left in places where children played, but never where a grown man or woman could see it.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "One day near a lake, a brother and sister were playing.\u00a0 They saw the magic ball at the foot of a little hill. Delighted with the shiny bright ball the girl, Natalia, ran to it.\u00a0 But to her surprise, as she drew near to it, the magic ball rolled away.\u00a0 Then a little way off, it came to rest again. Again she ran to it and almost had her hand upon it when it escaped, exactly as a piece of thistle-down does, just as she was about to grasp it.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "So Natalia followed the ball, always seeming to be on the point of catching it but never quite doing so. As she ran, her older brother Luis followed her. The strange part was that every time the magic ball stopped, it rested close to some berry bush or by the edge of a crystal-clear spring, so that Natalia, like all the other children who had been led away, found at the moment of resting something to eat or drink to refresh herself.",
      "\n",
      "At last, Natalia with Luis right behind her, came to a place in the valley where a wide river ran between two great hills. The land was strewn with mighty broken rocks and here and there were patches of snow.\u00a0 Soon great snowflakes appeared in a dark and gloomy air. Then brother and sister were terror-struck, for they knew with all the wandering and twisting and turning, they had lost their way. But the magic ball still rolled on, though slower now, and the children followed it. The air grew colder and the sun weaker, so they were very glad indeed when they came to a black rock where at last, the magic ball stopped.",
      "\n",
      "Natalia picked it up.\u00a0 For a moment she gazed at its beauty, but for a moment only. For no sooner had she gazed at it than it vanished as a soap bubble does, and she cried out in grief. Luis tried to cheer her by reaching out to hold her hands.\u00a0 Finding them icy cold, he led her to the north side of the rock where it was protected from the wind. There Natalia coiled herself up and was asleep in a minute. Luis sat down near the rock, thinking that as soon as his sister had rested they must find their way back home. He tried hard to stay awake so he could keep watch, even holding his eyelids open with his fingers, but that only seemed to make him sleepier. Then, with the pine trees slowly nodding about him and the leaves softly whispering, soon Luis, too, slept.",
      "\n",
      "Natalia, being out of the blustering wind, was very comfortable in the niche carved within the great stones, and she dreamed that she was at home. Her mother, she thought, was combing her hair and singing as she did so. But her mother, she thought, grew rough and careless and pulled her hair.\u00a0 Natalia gave a little cry of pain and awoke. She tried to rise but could not.\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "Natalia's heart was like stone when she found what had happened. It was this: While she slept, the old witch of the Andes Mountains had stroked and combed her hair, and meanwhile wrought magic, so that the girl's hair was grown into the rock so very closely that she could not as much as turn her head. All that she could do was to stretch forth her arms, and when she saw Luis a little way off, she called to him most piteously.\u00a0\u00a0But he was not able to reach her, for you see the old witch had bound Natalia with a spell.\u00a0 There was now an invisible wall around the rock through which her brother could not pass, try as he might.",
      "\n",
      "\"Brother, come to me!\" called Natalia through the invisible wall, and she started to cry.",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Sister,\" he said, \"I try but I cannot. There is something through which I cannot pass. I can see you but I cannot pass through.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you not climb over, dear Luis?\" asked Natalia.",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Natalia. I have reached as high as I can, but the wall that I cannot see goes up and up. But I will stay here with you, so don't be afraid.\"",

      "Nearby came the voice of a great white owl, that sung:",

      " ",
      " Steer clear of the blaze from a torch's red flame.",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sister.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Does it mean anything to you?\" she asked.",
      "\n",
      "\"Not really,\" he replied.",
      "\n",
      "\"Listen,\" said Natalia. \"It said 'Things of the dark and things without name, steer clear of the blaze from a torch's red flame.'\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I heard it, Natalia,\" said he. \"But what does it mean?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"It must mean that the things in this horrible valley fear fire. So that's what you must bring back here. Leave me and go find some fire. And please hurry back as soon as you can!\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Luis was in no mood to leave his sister all alone, and stuck inside a magic bubble that could do her no good. Still she urged him, saying, \"It's okay, Luis.\u00a0 Please, I need you to go so you can bring back the fire!\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Still, Luis didn't want to leave her.\u00a0 Just then an Andeas condor, a very large flying bird, flew overhead. In a great dive, it swooped over the rock.\u00a0 The condor said as it wheeled low, \"Fire will conquer frosted death.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you hear that, brother?\" said Natalia. \"The condor says the same thing. It must be true.\u00a0 You must go quickly so you can return before it gets too dark to find me again.\"",
      "\n",
      "So Luis waved his sister a farewell and set off down the valley, following the condor that hovered in the air, now darting away and now returning, and trying to remember the way he was going. Luis knew that the great bird was leading him somewhere, and he followed.\u00a0 Soon the condor led him to a river, the Rio Chico, and he followed it until he reached the great place where two rivers meet by a marshy, swampy lake.",
      "\n",
      "And there was a house, a poor structure made of earth and stones snuggled in a warm fold of the hills. No one was home.\u00a0 The condor flew high and then circling in the air, he became a small speck to Luis.\u00a0 So he knew that he should stay for awhile and see what might come. Pushing open the door, he saw by the ashes in the fireplace that someone lived there, for there were red embers neatly covered to keep the fire alive. So he made himself useful, which was the way of that country, and brought fresh water from the spring. He gathered wood and piled it neatly by the fireside. Next he blew upon the embers and added twigs and sticks until a bright fire glowed.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The man who lived there must have come into the house somehow, because when Luis turned around there the man was, sitting on a stool and nodding his head. He offered Luis bread and yerba tea. As they ate and quenched their thirst, Luis told the old man what had happened to his sister.\u00a0 The old man said, \"Wicked is the old witch of the Andes Mountains. There is only one way to defeat her. Tell me, lad, do you know what it is?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Could it be this?\" said Luis, remembering what the condor had said. \"Fire will conquer frosted death.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's it exactly,\" nodded the old man. \"And trust me, there is no time to lose.\u00a0 Look, here comes your friend the condor.\" As the condor swooped low by the door, it said:",
      "\n",
      " Now with the cold, grows faint her breath,",
      "\n",
      " ",
      " Fire will conquer frosted death.",
      "\n",

Around the lake, along the river's edge, over snowclad burrows and small hills he ran, pausing only to catch his breath. But -- alas! -- when he tried to get a better hold of the lighted branch, he dropped it in the snow. When he picked it up again, it was but a charred, black thing. Luis was heartsick, and could do nothing but return to the house, bearing the blackened stick, and beg to be given a third chance.",

He gripped the stick so tightly that his fingers hurt, yet he would not let up, even for a second, and continued racing, racing, like a deer. A flamingo, seeing him, spread her wings like sails and ran by his side. On her back Luis placed his free hand, and with that help he sped as fast as the flamingo while her wings protected the flame. Luis held the flamingo tight and the flamingo shot up into the air like an arrow. The blazing fire grazed her neck and breast until it became pink and red, but that she heeded not, and flew on.",

Up leaped the dancing flames.\u00a0 With a tremendous noise, the rock that had entrapped his sister by her hair flew into a thousand pieces and the enchantment that had surrounded her was broken. The power of the old witch of the Andes Mountains was gone forever. Natalia was freed!\u00a0 With her gentle, cool hand, Natalia stroked the breast of the flamingo so that the bird's burns were healed.\u00a0 But as a sign of its bravery, the flamingo has carried a crimson breast from that day to this.",

      "ONCE UPON A TIME",
      ", there was a girl so poor that she had to wander about the world looking for work. One day a farmer hired her to watch his cows. So each day she would take his cows to the meadow and bring them back at the end of the day.",
      "\n",
      "One morning in the meadow, the girl heard a loud groan that sounded almost human. She rushed to the spot. There, to her surprise, was a lion crying out in pain.",
      "\n",
      "Though she was scared the girl drew nearer, and saw that he had a large thorn in one foot. She carefully pulled out the thorn, bound up the wound with her handkerchief, and the lion licked her hand with his big rough tongue. Suddenly remembering her cows, the girl rushed back to the meadow. But alas! She hunted everywhere but could not find even one cow. What could she do but to return home and confess to her master? He scolded her bitterly and afterwards beat her. Then he said, \"Tomorrow you will have to look after the pigs. Be sure you do not lose any of them!\"",
      "\n",
      "Exactly one year after she had found the lion, the girl was tending the pigs one morning when she again heard a groan which sounded quite human. And there was the same lion on the ground, this time with a deep wound across his face.",
      "\n",
      "No longer afraid of the creature, she washed the wound, lay healing herbs upon it, and bound it up. The lion thanked her as he had done before.",
      "\n",
      "Worried, she rushed back. But again, the pigs in her flock were gone! She searched everywhere, but it was no use.",
      "\n",
      "She sank to the ground and wept bitterly, not daring to return again to her master empty-handed. At last she thought that if she climbed a tree she might get a wider view of the land and find her lost pigs. But no sooner was she seated on the highest branch than something happened which put the pigs quite out of her mind. Out of the woods walked a handsome young man who came to her tree. He moved aside a large rock by the tree trunk, stepped down into what looked like a deep black hole, and disappeared.",

      "\u00a0",

      "Now the maiden was so curious that she decided to stay in the tree all night long until the young man came out again. The next morning, the rock was moved aside, but out came not the young man, but a lion instead. The lion looked around, then very slowly padded into the forest and disappeared from view.",
      "\n",
      "Now the maiden was so curious that she climbed down the tree to see the rock for herself. It seemed like an ordinary enough rock. Yet she easily pushed it aside and discovered a deep opening underneath. She gingerly stepped down, found a toehold, and following a path was led to a beautiful house. In the house she discovered a library, and there she passed hours reading very good books, and left a favorite of hers out on the table. Then she prepared a good dinner (eating a bit of it herself, as she was very hungry!), and clambered back up to the top of her tree. She looked again for her lost pigs, but not a trace of one could she see.",
      "\n",
      "As the sun set, the same lion, walking much better this time, came out of the woods and back to the rock under the tree. Down he went and a while later, out came the same young man. Again he looked about him left and right, saw no one, and softly stepped into the forest.",

      "The maiden came down from the tree and did what she had done the day before, each time leaving a different book on the table and preparing a meal before she left. Thus three days went by. The next time the young man emerged, she called out, \"Stop! Please, won't you tell me your name?\"",
      "\n",
      "The young man, surprised, said, \"Why, you must be the one who's been setting out the books and preparing my dinner!\" He explained that he was a prince. Years ago, he had been captured by a giant who cast a spell on him. All day long he must be a lion. Only at night could he return to his human shape. As a lion, he had been the very one whom she had helped twice before. What's more, he whispered, the giant who had enchanted him was the very same one who had stolen her cows and her pigs, out of spite for the kindnesses she had shown to him, when he had been wounded as a lion.",
      "\n",
      "The girl asked, \"How can you be freed from the spell?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"There is only one way,\" he said with a sigh, \"and that is if someone can get a lock of hair from the head of a king's daughter, spin it, and from its cloth weave a cloak for the giant.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I will go at once to the king's palace,\" said the girl.",
      "\n",
      "So they parted. When the girl arrived at the king's palace she was careful to wash herself and neatly arrange her hair. Quickly she was hired as a kitchen maid. Soon everyone at the palace talked about her neat and clean appearance.",
      "\n",
      "By and by the princess heard of her and sent for the girl. When she saw her, and how beautifully she had arranged her hair, the princess told her she was to come and comb out hers.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Now the hair of the princess was very thick and shone like gold. The girl combed it and combed till it was brighter than the sun. The princess was pleased and invited her to come every day and comb her hair. At last the girl took courage and asked permission to cut off one of the long, thick locks.",
      "\n",
      "The princess, who was very proud of her hair, did not like the idea of parting with any of it, so she said no. But each day the girl begged to be allowed to cut off just one lock of her thick hair. At last the princess gave in. \"Very well then!\" she finally exclaimed, \"you may have it, on one condition -- that you find for me the finest prince in all the land to be my bridegroom!\"",
      "\n",
      "The girl answered that she would do so, and she cut off the lock. When she was alone, she wove it into a cloak that glittered like silk. When she brought it to the young man, he told her to carry it straight to the giant, who lived on top of a high mountain. But he warned her that she must announce loudly that she was bringing the cloak, or the giant would surely attack her.",
      "\n",
      "Before the maiden reached the top of the mountain, out rushed the giant, waving in one hand a sword and a club in the other. Quickly she called out that she had brought him a cloak. At that, the giant stopped and invited her into his house.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "He tried on the cloak but it was too short. Angry, he threw it onto the floor. The girl picked up the cloak and quickly left. She returned quite in despair to the king's palace.",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, when she was combing the princess' hair, she begged and begged for permission to cut off just one more lock. At last the princess gave in, on one condition - that the prince whom the girl should find for her to marry would also be the handsomest prince in the entire world.",
      "\n",
      "The maiden said softly that she had already found such a prince for her. Later, the girl spun more thread from the second lock. Now she could lengthen the giant's cloak and sleeves. When it was finished, she carried it again to the giant.",
      "\n",
      "This time the cloak fit perfectly! The giant was quite pleased, and he asked her what he could do for her in return. She said that the only reward he could give her was to take the spell off the prince so he could stay human, night and day.",
      "\n",
      "For a long time the giant would not hear of reversing his spell, but he liked the cloak so well that at last he said yes. He even told her the cows and pigs would be returned to her master by the end of the day. And this was the secret to freeing the prince of the enchantment - she must cast the lion into the pond near the mountain until he was entirely underwater. Then, when the prince finally emerged he would be free from the enchantment forever.",
      "\n",
      "The maiden went away in despair, for fear that the giant was trying to trick her, and that after she had cast the lion into the water she would find that she had only drowned the prince.",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom of the mountain, she joined the prince, who was waiting for her. When he heard her story he comforted her, and bade her to be of good courage, and to do as the giant had said. And so in the morning when he emerged in his lion's form, the maiden cast him into the pond near the mountain until he was entirely underwater. Soon after, out of the water came the prince, beautiful as the day, and as glad to look upon as the sun himself.",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The young man thanked the maiden for all she had done for him, and declared that he would like her to be his wife and none other. But the maiden cried out that it could never be, for she had already given her promise to the princess when she had cut off her hair that the prince would wed her and her alone.",
      "\n",
      "The prince sighed and said, \"Then that is what must be.\"",
      "\n",
      "They went together to the king's palace, where the princess with the golden hair lived. When the king and queen saw the young man approach, a great joy filled their hearts.",
      "\n",
      "It was their eldest son! He had long ago been enchanted by a giant and had disappeared from the castle. Their daughter, the princess with the golden hair, was delighted to see her long-lost brother.",
      "\n",
      "The prince asked his parents' permission to marry the girl who had saved him. His sister happily released the maiden from her promise, as she surely would not marry her own brother! Before long she married another prince from a neighboring kingdom. And so the maiden and the prince were married, later became the rulers of the land, and over time they richly deserved all the honors showered upon them.",

After many days, he came to a hut so overgrown with weeds he almost didn't notice a very old woman tending her garden beside it. Even after the old woman stood up, she was not much taller. Cedric thought he had never met anyone that old and wrinkled and hunched over - surely the woman must be over a hundred years old! He said, \"Old woman, do allow me to help with your garden.\" He pulled out all the weeds, cut down some grasses, and set layers of thick grass between the plant rows so the grass would keep new weeds from coming up around the plants. He filled one of her baskets with vegetables from her garden - green beans, brussel sprouts, potatoes, beets and peas, and brought the basket inside to make her soup. The old woman, sipping her soup, asked the visitor why he was traveling so deep in the woods.",

      "\"Not bad remembering for an old woman, yes?\" She smiled a toothless smile. But then she shook her head. \"Young man,\" she said. \"I must tell you. In all my years - and I have lived a long time! - I have never seen a sword known as Gull.\u00a0 And I have surely seen no iron serpent.\u00a0 There is no mantle, red or otherwise, that can keep anyone safe from embers and fire.\u00a0 And for goodness sake, what stallion can ride clouds? So if you ask my advice.\" The old woman leaned forward. \"I'll tell you. Forget it. Forget about finding the Maiden in the Rosy Clouds.\" And she settled back in her chair.\u00a0 Soon the old woman nodded herself to sleep.",
      "\n",
      "Cedric stayed with the old woman a couple of more days.\u00a0 He repaired her cottage and drew plenty of fresh water for her.\u00a0 Then he went on his way. For many nights, he dreamt about the sword known as Gull, the red mantle and the stallion grey, but each time when he awoke, he did not have any better idea how to find them than he had had before. And with barely a coin in his pocket, even if he were lucky enough to come upon one of the magical items, he could hardly buy them anyway.",
      "\n",
      "Some weeks later, Cedric was traveling through a wild and desolate mountain region where dangerous gorges and dark ravines opened on every side. Suddenly he heard a desperate cry. An young boy burst past him followed by an enormous slithering snake, 200 feet long and 20 feet wide, with black hair shaking from its neck, shining thick horny scales from neck to tail, and flaming red eyes.",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, I wish my knife were bigger!\" Cedric pulled his small pocket knife from its sheath and ran toward the snake. Instantly the creature turned its attention away from the young boy, who escaped behind some boulders, to the young man waving the pocket knife. The snake seemed ready to destroy both boy and knife in one gulp. As Cedric charged the snake, his knife suddenly changed.\u00a0 It was a long, gleaming sword!\u00a0 With one mighty blow, the young man had chopped off the snake's head.",

Since it's in my own hand now I suppose it must be mine.\" Cedric went on his way, with hope fired in his heart that he must be on the right track to find the Maiden in the Castle of the Rose-Colored Clouds.",
      "\n",
      "Five years passed. While Cedric found many chances to put his sword to good use, he found no one who could tell him anything about the Maiden in the Castle of the Rose-Colored Clouds.",
      "\n",
      "One day he came to a village where the people were running frantically around, astir and beside themselves. One of the largest homes in the center of town had caught on fire. \"Alas! Old lame Father Lars is still up there!\" they cried in feaer. Indeed, as Cedric rushed toward the burning house he could see in the third floor window the shadow of a frantic old man. But how to get him out?\u00a0 The tallest ladder had already burned up, and no other ladder could reach past the second floor.",
      "\n",
      "\"I have only myself in the world, so what have I to lose?\" thought Cedric.\u00a0 He ran upstairs to the third floor while flames licked both legs. Outside, the villagers saw a shadow enter in front of the window and lift the old man as if he were a child, but in the next instant the entire building was aflame. \"Both Lars and the stranger are lost!\" they wailed. Yet moments later, with an astonishment they would relay to their children and grandchildren again and again in years to come, they saw the young man emerge from the flaming building quite unharmed, carrying on his back the old man who was just as surprised as they.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps none was as surprised, however, as Cedric himself.\u00a0 As he set down the old man, he noticed a red cape fluttering around them both. \"Of course!\" he thought, \"the red cape from the rhyme that protects from fire! Now I have two of the magical items - the sword of Gull and the red cape. The only one left between me and the Maiden in the Castle of the Rosy Clouds is the flying gray stallion.\"",

      "Ten more years passed. While Cedric brandished the sword of Gull, protected others from fire with the red cape, and performed many a great deed, he discovered no clue to bring him closer to his Maiden in the Castle of the Rose-Colored Clouds.",
      "\n",
      "By this time Cedric developed something he didn't have before - a companion. Another young man, impressed with Cedric's brave deeds, had become his friend and asked to accompany him on his adventures. Often the friend begged Cedric to share with him the secret of his success. Finally, Cedric confided in him the magic powers of the sword of Gull and the red cape. They talked long into the night. The next morning when Cedric awoke, the companion was gone and so were his sword and red cape.",
      "\n",
      "Cedric called for his friend everywhere.\u00a0 He followed his friend's footprints till they disappeared in the hard ground. He climbed a hill to get a better view.\u00a0 Out in the distance he noticed his companion, clutching the red mantle in one hand and his own sword in the other. ",
      "\n",
      "His companion had stolen his magical objects!\u00a0 Yet the next moment, something even more unbelievable took place. The red cape unfolded from under the young man's arms, rose into the air like a blanket, then grabbed his former friend like an eagle swooping for its prey, and held him aloft, kicking his legs and crying out in terror.",

      "\u00a0",

      "\n",
      "When it reached the other side of the canyon it dropped him to the ground on the other side.\u00a0 There he tumbled across the top of the cliff and out of sight until Cedric could see him no more.",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely he'll die of wounds from the fall if he's not already dead!\" Cedric thought, alarmed.\u00a0 He ran to the edge of the canyon. He knew he somehow must jump across to the other side. Cedric took a running start and leapt as wide as he could, but almost at the very moment his feet left the edge of the ravine he realized he didn't have enough momentum to bridge the gap and would surely fall to his death into the deep canyon.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "As he started to fall, Cedric somehow landed on something soft and realized he was riding a horse, a gray stallion in fact, that was riding through the air and taking him to safety to the other side. The moment they alighted, Cedric rushed to the young man, who moaned in mortal pain near the bushes.",
      "\n",
      "Hurriedly, Cedric ripped his clothes to make bandages to stop the flow of blood. When he had tightly bound the wounds and tucked soft grasses under the young man's head, Cedric stood up and looked around. The gray stallion was still there, neighing softly, and the sword of Gull, and the red cape, which had neatly folded itself, lay on the ground. Cedric slipped the sword back into its sheath, tied the red cape around his neck, and lifted his former companion on the stallion. He rode the young man to the next town, where he found a doctor and left him in the doctor's care.",
      "\n",
      "More long years passed. Cedric's cheeks became furrowed and his hair turned gray. His childhood friends had long since married and had children of their own, many of whom had grown up and married, too. Still, Cedric continued to ride the gray stallion in search of the maiden from the dream in his youth.",
      "\n",
      "Then one day in the distance swirled a rose-colored mist. Through the clouds the lad caught a glimpse of a golden spire of a castle glinting in the sun. The gray stallion seemed to know it and caught the excitement, eagerly starting on the winding road that led to the castle. ",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Cedric entered the foggy haze of the clouds, a fierce giant let out a roar and pounded toward him. As the giant, now close enough to strike, flung back its arm, Cedric clutched the sword of Gull. At that very moment, the giant vanished without a trace. Then everything was quiet except the galloping of the gray stallion, bounding up the mountainside toward the castle.",

      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "At last, he had arrived! The drawbridge lowered.\u00a0 Stepping out to welcome him was the very maiden of his dreams, the Maiden of the Castle of the Rose-Colored Clouds, only now she was real. She smiled with a warmth every bit as inviting and wonderful as he remembered.",
      "\n",
      "\"You have proven you are the man I knew you to be,\" she said. \"And now at last you are here, with me.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"But it took so long.\" The rider sighed. \"Now I am old and gray.\"",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The maiden only smiled.\u00a0 She took his hand and led him to the drawbridge over the moat. She pointed to his reflection in the water. Looking back at Cedric from the water was the image of his youth, a handsome young face with firm, strong cheeks. \u00a0Amazed, Cedric felt his own face - could it be?\u00a0 Then he took the maiden's hand.\u00a0 And so hand in hand, the two of them entered the castle together.",

      "A",
      "\u00a0KING, who was lying on his deathbed, called his only son to come to him.",
      "\n",
      "\"Son,\" he said, \"you shall be king after me. Your three sisters have no one but you to look after them. When it is time for them to marry, this is what you must do.\u00a0 There is no need to go about seeking great princes far away to be their husbands.\u00a0 You know that rose tree that grows in the palace garden and flowers all year around? Pluck a rose from it and throw it into the street. Whoever shall pick it up shall have your eldest sister for his wife. Do the same for your second sister. And the same for your third.\"",
      "\n",
      "The son was stunned.\u00a0 \"Father,\" he said, \"are you sure that is the best way?\"\u00a0 It was the practice in the day for young princes and princesses to meet and see if they liked each other.\u00a0 Then if so, they would marry.",
      "\n",
      "\"I am still the King of this land!\" said his father with sudden anger, then his head dropped down on his pillow.\u00a0 The son dare not tire out the sick man any longer, and so he gave his word.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "Therefore when the eldest sister had grown into a beautiful princess and the court advisers said it was time for her to marry, her brother told her of their father's command. \"That's the silliest thing I ever heard!\" she said.\u00a0 \"I'd rather not marry at all!\"\u00a0 But these were the days when what a King said must be carried out. (Aren't you glad times are different now?)",
      "\n",
      "We shall return to the story.\u00a0 So the prince, who was now King, plucked a rose from the rose tree in the palace garden.\u00a0 He threw it into the street and told the sentry at the palace door to watch who should pick it up.\u00a0 Whoever it was must be sent to the royal chamber. Soon there came walking along a fine young count, splendidly dressed, with a jeweled sword by his side, and a manner brave and jolly. He saw the rose, picked it up and stuck it in his velvet cap.",
      "\n",
      "\"The king demands to speak with you!\" said the sentry, stepping forward. The count, anxious, entered the palace, and bowed low before the King, worrying what may be the matter.\u00a0 Said the King: \"You have been chosen as the husband of my eldest sister!\" The count could not believe his luck!.\u00a0 The princess grumbled. \"This is no way for a princess to marry!\u00a0 I should have married a king, or at least a prince!\" Her brother, however, had no choice; he had given his word.\u00a0 Nor did the sister.\u00a0 However the princess watched the count carefully.\u00a0 She thought to herself, \"It could be worse.\u00a0 I have met many a prince who did not have such a fine, jolly manner.\u00a0 This young man is young and handsome and I can see where he would make me laugh. I could have fared much worse.\" And so she married the count.",
      "\n",
      "A couple of years later, it was time for the second princess to marry. She was just as unwilling as her elder sister to marry whoever happened to pick up the rose and found the whole idea ridiculous.\u00a0 Her brother reminded her of their father's command. And besides, her older sister seemed happy with her match.\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "So the brother plucked a rose, threw it out in the street, and asked the sentry to watch who should pick it up. By and by, a rich merchant came along, a grave, serious, solid and dignified man. He saw the rose, looked at it as if it were a pity such a pretty thing should be wasted, picked it up, dusted it off, and placed it neatly in the button-hole of his fine cloth doublet.",
      "\n",
      "\"The king desires to speak with you,\" said the sentry, stepping forward.",
      "\n",
      "\"A great honor, indeed!\" replied the merchant. \"I will attend his majesty without delay.\" He entered the palace and heard what the king had to say to him. \"But I am not even a nobleman!\" the merchant objected. \"Surely the princess would marry a much greater man than I.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"This is her father's wish,\" said the King. And so the matter was settled.",
      "\n",
      "Like her elder sister, the princess grumbled at first. A mere merchant, indeed! \"But at least,\" she had to admit at last, \"he seems honest, hard-working and serious.\u00a0 Not a joker as so many other men are.\u00a0 And while he was not a very young man, he was not that old either, and had a way about him that was appealing. \"I might have fared worse,\" she though.\u00a0 And so the second princess married the merchant and went to his new home to live.",
      "\n",
      "At last came the turn of Julietta, the youngest princess. For her, the king did as for her two older sisters. He plucked the rose, threw it into the street, and told the sentry to watch who should pick it up, and send him in. Now, who should come by but a poor lame water-carrier! Such an ugly, dirty little man! He saw the rose, picked it up, and put it to his nose to draw in the sweet fragrance.",
      "\n",
      "The sentry stepped forward. He said to the water-carrier, \"The king desires to speak with you!\"",
      "\n",
      "The water-carrier sadly looked at his tattered clothes and ragged sandals. To be seen before the the king in such rags! But when the king commands . . . He slunk up the marble steps and entered the palace.",
      "\n",
      "\"You picked up the rose?\" said the king, eyeing him with dismay.",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sire! But if you please, sire! I meant no harm by it.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you must marry my youngest sister, Julietta.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" the water-carrier called out in alarm.\u00a0 \"Your majesty is making a mockery of me.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all! Not at all!\" And the beggar was told of the dead king's command.",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am miserably poor and as you see -- my leg is lame -- and I am ugly! Such a match is impossible!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it were!\" sighed the king. \"But this is the way it must be.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor wretch who can scarcely feed her!\" cried the poor man. Then he sighed. \"Well, if it must be, then at least please do not send any dowry with her. It would only make it worse for her to have fine things in the poor home where she must live.\"",
      "\n",
      "The grief of the poor young princess was heartrending. Her brother wept too, and it was a miserable wedding. It was no comfort the two older sisters seemed contented enough.\u00a0 This was too much!\u00a0 But it couldn't be helped. So Julietta went away with her water-carrier to his shabby hut on the hill. ",
      "\n",
      "On the way all the people who saw them cried, \"Look! there goes the princess with that Rags-and-Tatters!\" Home she went to the miserable place, to live there with her new husband, Rags-and-Tatters, and his old crone of a mother.",
      "\n",
      "\"This is no place for such fine clothes,\" said the old woman. She gave Julietta a rough dress to wear and wooden shoes, and made her scour and wash and bake and darn, and tend to her husband's lame leg. There was only the coarsest food to eat -- and little enough of that.",
      "\n",
      "Poor Julietta wept and wept, and could not be comforted. Rags-and-Tatters, though he did not want so fine a wife, was full of pity for her. But what could he do? The only time she had any joy was when she was asleep. Then she dreamed beautiful dreams. One night she dreamt she was in a grand palace, warm and light and spacious. She wore lovely clothes and jewels in her hair; and the tables were spread with delicious things to eat. She sat down at the table with friends dressed as beautifully as herself, and everyone was having a fine time. When she woke up she told her husband all about it. But Rags-and-Tatters shook his head and said, \"A dream is but a dream, my wife. It must be hard for you to think of such memories.\u00a0 Think no more of this.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Julietta!\" snapped the old woman. \"It is time to get up and kindle the fire.\u00a0 What are you waiting for?\"",
      "\n",
      "Some weeks later, Julietta dreamt the same dream again. Of course, she told her husband about it in the morning.",
      "\n",
      "\"It's best you forget these dreams,\" he said. \"It only makes it harder for you here.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Get used to the real world, girl,\" snapped the old woman, pointing. \"There's the wash tub. Get started.\"",
      "\n",
      "Yet that very night, Julietta was back in the beautiful palace in her dreams, with servants to wait on her and jeweled clothes to wear. Again the banquet was rich and splendid, the flowers were rare and fragrant, the music soft and pleasant. But as they were rising from the table someone looked up at the golden ceiling. There in the hole a little man was gazing downward. \"Look! look!\" cried a man at the table. \"There is Rags-and-Tatters!\" Just then, in the twinkling of an eye the dream vanished, and the princess was sitting up in her bed by the hearth in the hut on the hill, clad in her old sleeping frock.",
      "\n",
      "She moaned to her husband over all she had lost and left behind. In his heart he really felt very sorry for her. \"What's done is done,\" he said softly. \"We must try to make the best of it.\"",
      "\n",
      "For weeks and weeks she wept every day. Then one night, she dreamt once more of the beautiful palace. As soon as Rags-and-Tatters was recognized and his name was called out, the entire dream disappeared again. The next night, however, she was back in the lovely palace again, richly clad, and with servants to wait on her. The banquet was more splendid than ever. But this time, before they sat down, in her dream the Princess Julietta spoke to her assembled guests.",
      "\n",
      "\"Make merry, my friends,\" she said. \"Only one thing is forbidden. Let none of you breathe the name,\" -- and then she whispered -- \"of Rags-and-Tatters!\"",
      "\n",
      "They all sat down, ate, drank and made merry, and charming music sounded all about them the while. Then one of the company looked up at the hole in the golden roof. There again, the little man was gazing down on them all. It was just on the tip of his tongue to cry out, \"Rags-and-Tatters!\" but he caught himself just in time. The princess herself looked up and saw the figure in the hole in the roof. A sudden ray of fondness lit up her heart.",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor man!\" she said softly to herself. \"What a good fellow he is, and how I sadden him with my complaints! I wish Rags & Tatters were down here with us in the midst of it all, and enjoying it with us!\"",
      "\n",
      "And then -- did the lights, the music, the flowers and the guests, the palace and everything, disappear as before? Not at all! At the end of the banquet hall appeared two thrones of gold. On one of them sat a fair young prince, clad in velvet and jewels. His hair shone like the sun, and his eyes were of hyacinth blue, and his smile gladdened the heart of everyone. While they stood in amazement, he rose and said, \"Welcome, my guests! My wife has entertained you while I have been away. You will not be less merry, I hope, now that I have come home!\" And he drew the Princess Julietta forward, and placed her on the throne by his side. Then they danced and sang and were joyous, till the stars faded and daylight streamed through the windows of the hall.",
      "\n",
      "For Rags-and-Tatters was not Rags-and-Tatters at all, but Prince Florio, the son of the king of Portugal. A wicked enchantress had cast a spell on the young prince because his father, the king of Portugal, had banished the enchantress from his land.\u00a0 The spell she had cast reduced the Prince to a hideous appearance, clothed only by old and dirty rags.\u00a0 The spell was to last until a princess loved him enough to desire his humble company even while she reveled in finery and elegance. Now Julietta had broken the spell when she longed for him in the midst of her splendor, with his rags and tatters and all.",
      "\n",
      "And what of his old mother? Why, she was not his real mother at all, but the wicked enchantress herself! Night after night, the crone had planted dreams in the princess of finery and lost glory. The following day, she delighted in mocking the prince when it was obvious that the princess had thought nothing of the prince during her dreams.\u00a0 For if she had, of course the spell would have been broken by morning.",
      "\n",
      "Prince Florio and Princess Julietta went home in triumph to Portugal, where they were married, lived happily and where their love only deepened as the years went by.",

      "\n",
      "Question 2: Is there someone you didn't like when first you met, but the more time you spent with that person, the more you liked him or her?",

      "Five hundred years ago when the Spanish entered South America, Native American tribes often fought back against the invaders. One way tribes could put pressure on the Spanish was to surround their settlements. This is what happened in the early 1500's when Maldonado, a Spanish girl, was 15 years old.",
      "\n",
      "Hostile Native Americans of the Querand\u00ed tribe had encircled the Spanish settlement where Maldonado lived. Before long, their food supplies were depleted. The people faced starvation. They begged their captain to allow them to take their chances and leave the settlement in search of food - but this the captain would not allow.",
      "\n",
      "Famished, Maldonado escaped the settlement and fled into the jungle. As night fell, she heard with alarm the calls of wild animals. Where could she safely sleep for the night? But there was one call that drew her closer. It was a cry of pain. She followed the sound to a cave where she found a puma that had just given birth.",

      "Long, long ago there lived a very rich nobleman who had a wonderful baby boy. The night before his son was born, the father had a dream. He dreamt that the only way his son would reach adulthood would be if the child's feet never touched the earth until he was twelve years old. ",
      "Great care was taken that this should be avoided, and only trustworthy nurses were hired to look after the child. As the years passed, he was always diligently guarded. Sometimes he was carried in his nurses' arms, sometimes the servants carried him in a chair, but the boy's feet never touched the ground. So it passed until the child was nearly twelve years old.",
      "\n",
      "Now when the child's twelfth birthday drew near, the father began to plan a magnificent feast to celebrate his son's release. One day while the preparations were in progress, a frightful noise, followed by most unearthly yells, shook the castle. In her terror, the nurse dropped the child and ran to the window. At that very instant the noises stopped.\u00a0 On turning around to pick up the boy again, imagine her alarm when she found him no longer there! With a cry, she realized that she had disobeyed her master's orders. The child's feet had touched the floor, and now the child was gone.",
      "\n",
      "Hearing her screams and wails, all the servants of the castle ran to her. The father soon followed, asking, \"What is the matter? What has happened? Where is my son?\" The nurse, trembling and weeping, told of the boy who vanished, and so soon before his twelfth birthday.",
      "\n",
      "No words can describe the anguish of the father's heart. He sent servants in every direction to hunt for the boy; he gave orders; he begged; he threw away money left and right; he promised everything, anything! if only his son might be brought back to him. Search was made immediately, but no trace of the boy could be found. He had vanished as completely as if he had never existed.",
      "\n",
      "Many years later the unhappy nobleman learned that in one of the most beautiful rooms of the castle, footsteps, as if someone were walking up and down the halls, and dismal cries and groans, were heard each night at midnight. Anxious to follow up the matter, for he thought it might in some way give a clue as to the whereabouts of his lost son, he made known that a reward of three hundred gold pieces would be given to anyone who would watch for one entire night in the haunted room. Many were willing, but had not the courage to stay till the end; for at midnight, when they heard dismal groans and footsteps coming closer and closer, they would shriek and run away rather than risk their lives for three hundred pieces of gold. The poor father was in despair, and knew not how to discover the truth of this dark mystery.",
      "\n",
      "Now close to the castle there dwelt a widow, a miller by trade, who had three daughters. The family was very poor, and hardly earned enough to meet their daily needs. When they heard of the midnight noises in the castle and the promised reward of 300 gold pieces, the eldest daughter said, \"As we are so very poor, surely we have nothing to lose. We might try to earn these three hundred gold pieces by remaining in the room for one night. I should like to try, Mother, if you'll let me.\"",

But when she thought of their poverty and the difficulty they had day to day in setting food on the table, she gave permission for her eldest daughter to remain one night in the haunted room. Then the daughter went to the castle to ask the nobleman's consent.",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you really the courage to watch for a whole night in a room haunted by ghosts?\" said the nobleman. \"Are you sure you are not afraid, my good girl?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I am willing to try, and I can start this very night,\" said the eldest daughter. \"I only ask you to give me some food to cook for my supper, for I am very hungry.\"",
      "\n",
      "Orders were given that she should be supplied with everything she wanted, and indeed enough food was given to her, not for one supper only, but for three.\u00a0 With the food, some dry firewood, and a candle she entered the room. She first lit the fire and put on her saucepans, then she laid the table and made the bed. This filled up the early part of the evening. The time passed so quickly that she was surprised to hear the clock strike twelve. At the last stroke, footsteps, as if of someone walking, shook the room, and dismal groans filled the air. The frightened girl ran from one corner to the other, but could see no one. But the footsteps and the groans only got louder.",

      "\n",
      "On the following day the second daughter, having been told by her sister what to expect and how to answer the stranger, went to the castle to offer her services and to earn another three hundred gold pieces.\u00a0 The nobleman agreed, and she was provided with everything she might want. Without loss of time she entered the room, lit the fire, put on the saucepans, spread a white cloth upon the table, made the bed, and waited for the hour of midnight. When the young stranger appeared and asked, \"For whom is this food prepared? for whom is the table laid? for whom is the fire built?\" she answered as her sister had bidden her to do: \"For me, for myself only.\"",

      "On the third day the youngest daughter wanted to try her fortune.",
      "\n",
      "Now the widow dreaded to expose her youngest daughter to any danger, but as the two elder ones had succeeded in staying in the room and bringing home three hundred gold pieces, she allowed her to take a chance. So with the instructions from her two older sisters as to what she should expect and what she should say, and with the nobleman's consent and abundant provisions, she entered the haunted room. Having lit the fire, put on the saucepans, laid the table, and made the bed, she waited with hope and fear for the midnight hour.",
      "\n",
      "As twelve o'clock struck, the room was shaken by the footsteps of someone who walked up and down, and the air was filled with cries and groans. The girl looked everywhere, but no living being could she see. Suddenly there stood before her a young man. He pointed to the table and asked, \"For whom have you prepared this food?\"",

      "\n",
      "At these words his brow grew more relaxed.",
      "\n",
      "\"And this table, for whom is it spread?\"",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment, a deep opening appeared in the middle of the floor. The youth descended into the hole. She, anxious to see what lay below the floor, followed him, holding on to his mantle. Thus they both reached the bottom.",
      "\n",
      "Down below a new world opened itself before her eyes. To the right flowed a river of liquid gold; to the left rose high mountains of solid gold; in the center lay a large meadow covered with millions of flowers. The stranger went on; the girl behind him followed unnoticed. As he went, he saluted the field flowers as old friends. Then they came to a forest where the trees were all of gold. Many birds flew around the young man, perching on his head and shoulders. While he spoke to and petted each one, the girl broke off a branch from one of the golden trees and hid it as a remembrance of this strange golden land.",

      "When the young stranger had said good-bye to all his friends, he returned by the paths he had come. Arriving at the foot of the opening to the castle room, he began to rise, she coming silently after, holding on to his mantle. Up they went higher and higher, until they reached the opening to the room in the castle. The floor closed up behind them without a trace. The girl returned to her place by the fire, where she was sitting when the young man approached.",
      "\n",
      "\"All my farewells have been spoken,\" said he. \"Now we can have supper.\"",
      "\n",
      "She hastened to place upon the table the food she had prepared before, and sitting side by side in front of the fire they supped together. When they had finished he said, \"Now it is time to rest.\"",
      "\n",
      "He lay down on the bed, and the girl placed by his side the gold and silver branches she had picked in the sparkling world below the floor. In a few moments he was sleeping peacefully. She then settled comfortably in a soft chair beside him.",
      "\n",
      "The next day the sun was already high in the sky, and yet the girl had not come out of the room to give an account of what had happened.

      "However, one morning her mother looked so tired that even the selfish girl could not help seeing it.\u00a0 She asked if there was anything she was able to do so that her mother might rest a little.",
      "\n",
      "The good woman looked so surprised and grateful for this offer that the girl felt rather ashamed, and at that moment would have scrubbed down the house if she had been requested.\u00a0 But her mother only begged her to take the fishing-net out to the bank of the river and mend some holes in it, as her father intended to go fishing that night.",
      "\n",
      "The girl took the net and worked so hard that soon there was not a hole to be found. She felt quite pleased with herself,.\u00a0 All this time she had had plenty of company to amuse her, as everybody who passed by had stopped to have a chat with her. But by this time the sun was high overhead, and she was just folding her net to carry it home again, when she heard a splash behind her.\u00a0 Looking around she saw a big fish jump into the air. At once seizing the net with both hands, she flung it into the water and drew out the fish.",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you are quite a fine looking fish!\" she said.\u00a0 But the fish looked up to her and said, \"You had better not kill me, for if you do, I will turn you into a fish yourself!\"",

      "\n",
      "\"Look what I caught!\" she said gaily. She left the fish with her mother, and off she went to gather some flowers to stick in her hair.",
      "\n",
      "About an hour later the blowing of a horn told her that dinner was ready.",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I say that fish would be delicious?\" she cried. Plunging her spoon into the dish the girl helped herself to a large piece. But the instant it touched her mouth a cold shiver ran through her. Her head seemed to flatten and her eyes to look oddly round the corners. Her legs and arms were stuck to her sides, and she gasped wildly for breath. With a mighty bound she sprang through the window and fell into the river, where she soon felt better and was able to swim down the river to the sea, which was close by.",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had she arrived under the sea than the sight of her sad face attracted the notice of some of the other fishes.\u00a0 They pressed around her, begging her to tell them her story.",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not a fish at all,\" said the newcomer, swallowing a great deal of salt water as she spoke, for you cannot learn how to be a proper fish all in a moment.\u00a0 \"I am not a fish but a girl, at least I was a girl only a few minutes ago --\" And she ducked her head under the waves so that they should not see her crying.",
      "\n",
      "\"Only you did not believe that the fish you caught had the power to carry out its threat,\" said an old tuna. \"Well, never mind, that has happened to many of us, and it really is not such a bad life. Cheer up and come with us and see our Queen, who lives in a palace.\"",
      "\n",
      "The new fish felt a little afraid of taking such a journey, but as she was still more afraid of being left alone, she waved her tail in token of consent. Off they all set, hundreds of them swimming together. At first our little fish felt as if she were blind in the dark waters, but by-and-by she began to make out one object after another in the green dimness.\u00a0 By the time she had swum for a few hours, all became clear.",
      "\n",
      "\"Here we are at last!\" cried a big fish, going down into a deep valley. For the sea has its mountains and valleys just as much as the land. \"That is the palace of the Queen of the Fishes, and I think you must confess that the Emperor himself has nothing so fine.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"It is beautiful indeed,\" gasped the little fish, who was very tired with trying to swim as fast as the rest. The palace walls were made of pale pink coral, worn smooth by the waters, and round the windows were rows of pearls. ",

      "The great doors were standing open, and the whole troop floated into the chamber of audience, where before them was the Queen. She was mermaid-like, having a human form from the head to the waist and a tail from the waist down.",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you, and where do you come from?\" said the Queen to the little fish, whom the others had pushed in front. And in a low, trembling voice, the visitor told her story.",
      "\n",
      "When the fish had ended the Queen answered, \"I was once a young woman too, a princess in fact, and my father was the king of a great country. A husband was found for me and on my wedding day my mother placed her crown on my head and told me that as long as I wore the crown I should likewise be queen. ",
      "\n",
      "For a few years I was as happy as a young woman could be, especially when I had a little son to play with. But one morning, when I was walking in my gardens, along came a giant who snatched the crown from my head. Holding me fast, he told me that he intended to give my crown to his daughter, and to put her in my place.\u00a0 He would enchant my husband the prince, so he should not know the difference between us. Since then she had filled my place and has been queen in my stead. ",
      "\n",
      "\"As for me, I was so miserable that I threw myself into the sea, and my ladies, who loved me, declared that they would die too. But instead of dying, some wizard, who pitied my fate, turned us all into fishes, though he allowed me to keep the face and upper body of a woman. And fishes we must remain until someone else brings me back my crown.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I will bring it back if you tell me what to do!\" cried the little fish, who would have promised anything that was likely to carry her up to earth again. And the Queen answered, \"Well then yes, I will tell you what to do.\"",
      "\n",
      "She sat silent for a moment, and then went on.",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no danger if you will only follow my counsel. First, you must return to earth and go up to the top of a high mountain, where the giant has built his castle. You will find him sitting on the steps weeping for his daughter, who has just died while my husband, who had been a prince but is now king of the land, was away hunting. But I warn you to be careful, for if he sees you he may kill you. Therefore I will give you the power to change yourself into any animal creature that may help you best. You have only to strike your forehead, and call out the name of the animal you wish to be. Mind you, you may not become any human or magical creature, but you may choose to become any animal of the forest, field or stream.",
      "\n",
      "This time the journey to land seemed much shorter than before.\u00a0 When once the little fish reached the shore, she struck her forehead sharply with her tail and cried, \"A deer, that's what I'd like to be!\"",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "In a moment the small slimy body disappeared, and in its place stood a beautiful beast with soft fur and slender legs, quivering with longing to be gone. Throwing back her head and snuffling the air, she broke into a run, leaping easily over the rivers and walls that stood in her way.",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the King's son had been hunting since daybreak, but had killed nothing.\u00a0 When the deer crossed his path as he was resting under a tree, he determined to have her. He flung himself on his horse, which flew like the wind, and as the prince had often hunted in the forest before and knew all the shortcuts, he at last came up with the panting beast.",
      "\n",
      "\"By your favor let me go, and do not kill me,\" said the deer, turning to the Prince with tears in her eyes, \"for I have far to run and much to do.\" And as the Prince, struck dumb with surprise, only looked at her, the deer cleared the next wall and was soon out of sight.",
      "\n",
      "\"That can't really be a deer,\" thought the Prince to himself, reining in his horse and not attempting to follow her. \"No deer ever had eyes like that. It must be an enchanted maiden, and I will marry her and no other.\" So, turning his horse's head, he rode slowly back to his palace.",
      "\n",
      "The deer reached the giant's castle quite out of breath, and her heart sank as she gazed at the tall, smooth walls which surrounded it. Then she plucked up courage and cried; \"An ant, that's what I'd like to be!\" And in a moment the soft fur and beautiful shape had vanished, and a tiny brown any, invisible to all who did not look closely, was climbing up the walls.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "It was wonderful how fast she went, that little creature! The wall must have appeared miles high in comparison with her own body, yet in less time than would have seemed possible, she was over the top and down in the courtyard on the other side. Here she paused to consider what had best be done next.\u00a0 Looking about her, she saw that one of the walls had a tall tree growing by it, and in this corner was a window very nearly on a level with the highest branches of the tree.",
      "\n",
      "\"A monkey, that's what I'd like to be!\" cried the ant.\u00a0 Before you could turn around, a monkey was swinging herself from the topmost branches into the room where the giant lay snoring.",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps the giant will be so startled at the sight of a swinging monkey that he may never give me the crown,\" thought the monkey. \"I had better become something else.\"",
      "\n",
      "Then she was a pink and gray parrot who hopped up to the giant, who by this time was stretching himself and giving yawns which shook the castle. The parrot waited a little, until he was really awake.\u00a0 Then she said boldly that she had been sent to take away the crown, which was not his any longer, now that his daughter the queen was dead.",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these words the giant leapt out of bed with an angry roar, and sprang at the parrot in order to wring her neck with his great hands. But the bird was too quick for him and flying behind his back, begged the giant to have patience, as her death would be of no use to him.",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true,\" answered the giant, \"but I am not so foolish as to give you that crown for nothing. Let me think what I will have in exchange!\" And he scratched his huge head for several minutes.",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes!\" he exclaimed at last, his face brightening. \"You shall have the crown if you bring me a collar of blue stones from the Great Arch.\"",
      "\n",
      "Now when the parrot had been a girl she had often heard of the wonderful Great Arch and its precious stones and marbles. It sounded as if it would be a very hard thing to get them away from the stone structure of which they formed a part.\u00a0 Still, all had gone well with her so far, and at any rate she could but try. So she bowed to the giant, and made her way back to the window where the giant could not see her. Then she called quickly, \"An eagle, that's what I'd like to be!\"",
      "\n",
      "Before she had even reached the tree she felt herself borne up on strong wings ready to carry her to the clouds if she wished to go there.\u00a0 Seeming a mere speck in the sky, she was swept along until she beheld the Great Arch far below, with the rays of the sun shining on it. She swooped down and, hiding herself behind a buttress so that she could not be detected from below, set herself to dig out the nearest blue stones with her beak. ",
      "\n",
      "It was even harder work than she expected but at last it was done, and hope arose in her heart. She next drew out a piece of string that she had found hanging from a tree.\u00a0 Sitting down to rest, she strung the stones together. When the necklace was finished she hung it round her neck and called, \"A parrot, that's what I'd like to be!\" So she quickly flew back, the necklace around her neck, and a little later the pink and gray parrot stood before the giant.\"Here is the necklace you asked for,\" said the parrot. The eyes of the giant glistened as he took the heap of blue stones in his hand. But for all that he was not minded to give up the crown.",
      "\n",
      "\"They are hardly as blue as I expected,\" he grumbled, though the parrot knew as well as he did that he was not speaking the truth. \"You must bring me a bag of stars from the sky. If you fail, it will cost you not only the crown but your life!\"",
      "\n",
      "The parrot was stunned.\u00a0 But what could she do?\u00a0 She turned away and as soon as she was outside she murmured, \"A toad, that's what I want to be!\" Sure enough a toad she was, and off she set in search of the bucket of stars.",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone far before she came to a clear pool, in which the stars were reflected so brightly that they looked quite real to touch and handle. Stooping down, she filled a bag she was carrying with the shining water and returned to the castle. Then she cried as before, \"A parrot, that's what I'd like to be!\" And in the shape of a parrot she entered the presence of the giant.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\"Come outside to see it,\" she said.\u00a0 And when the giant stood under the stars she opened the bag and said, \"Here is the bag of stars you asked for.\"\u00a0 This time, the giant could not help crying out with admiration.\u00a0 He knew he was beaten and he turned to the girl.",
      "\n",
      "\"Your power is greater than mine. So be it: Take this old crown, anyway.\"",
      "\n",
      "The parrot did not need to be told twice. Seizing the crown, she sprang on to the window, crying, \"A monkey, that's what I'd like to be!\" As a monkey, the climb down the tree into the courtyard did not take half a minute. When she had reached the ground she said again, \"An ant, that's what I'd like to be!\" And a little ant at once began to crawl over the high wall. How glad the ant was to be out of the giant's castle, holding fast the crown which had shrunk into almost nothing, as she herself had done, but grew quite big again when the ant exclaimed, \"A deer, that's what I'd like to be!\"",
      "\n",
      "Surely no deer ever ran so swiftly as that one! On and on she went, bounding over rivers and crashing through tangles till she reached the sea. Here she cried, \"A fish, that's what I'd like to be!\" And plunging in, she swam along the bottom as far as the palace, the crown held fast in her fins.\u00a0 There the Queen and all the fishes were gathered together awaiting her.",
      "\n",
      "The hours since she had left had passed very slowly -- as they always do to those who are waiting -- and many of them had quite given up hope.",
      "\n",
      "\"The young flies will be coming out about now,\" grumbled one of the fish, \"and they will all be eaten up by the river fish. It would really be too bad to miss them.\" When suddenly, a voice was heard from behind: \"Look! look! What is that bright thing moving so swiftly towards us?\" And the Queen started up and stood on her tail, so excited was she.",
      "\n",
      "A silence fell on all the crowd, and even the grumblers held their peace and gazed like the rest. On and on came the fish, holding the crown tightly in her fins, and the others moved back to let her pass. On she went right up to the Queen, who bent and, taking the crown, placed it on her own head. Then a wonderful thing happened. Her tail dropped away or, rather, it divided and grew into two legs while her maidens, grouped around her, shed their scales and became young women again. They all turned and looked at each other first, and next at the little fish who had regained her own shape also.",
      "\n",
      "\"It is you who have given us back our life - you, you!\" they cried, and fell to weeping from very joy.",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "So they all quickly swam to the surface and went back to the Queen's palace on land. But they had been away so long that they found many changes. Still the Queen's husband, now King, recognized her at once since the spell had been broken the moment the Queen had placed her rightful crown upon her head. The little boy she had left behind was now all grown up! Even at his joy at seeing his mother again, an air of sadness clung to him.\u00a0 At last the Queen could bear it no longer and she begged him to walk with her in the garden. Seated together in a bower of jasmine -- where she had passed long hours as a bride -- she took her son's hand and entreated him to tell her the cause of his sorrow. \"For,\" said she, \"if I can give you happiness you shall have it.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"It is no use,\" answered the Prince, \"nobody can help me. I must bear it alone.\"",
      "\n",
      "\"At least let me share your grief,\" urged the Queen.",
      "\n",
      "There was a silence between them for a moment.\u00a0 Then turning away his head, the Prince answered gently, \"I have fallen in love with a beautiful deer!\"",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, if that is all,\" exclaimed the queen joyfully. And she told him in broken words that, as he had guessed, it had been no deer but was in fact an enchanted maiden, the very one who had won back the crown for her and had brought her home to her own people.",
      "\n",
      "\"She is here, in my palace!\" added the Queen. \"I will take you to her.\"",
      "\n",
      "When the Prince stood before the girl, he lost all courage, and stood before her with bent head.",

      "\n",
      "\u00a0",
      "\n",
      "The maiden's eyes, as she looked at him, were the very same eyes of the deer that day in the forest. She whispered softly, \"By your favor let me go, and do not kill me.\"",
      "\n",
      "And the prince remembered her words, and her eyes, and his heart was filled with happiness. The Queen, his mother, watched them both and smiled.\u00a0 In the days and weeks that followed, the Prince and the girl spent more time together, and found that they seemed to be as comfortable together as time went by, as they had been the very first time they had met.",
      "\n",
      "The girl invited her parents to the royal wedding, a three-day feast that everyone enjoyed. And of course, the Queen saw to it that the missing blue stones in the Great Arch were restored.",

They will never bother you again!\" Then he ran to the other side. \"I know your enemy plans to set fire to your land. Quickly, you must set fire to their land before they do the same to you!\"",
      "\n",
      "Before long all the grasslands of the countryside were ablaze. And soon both sides had completely destroyed the other.",

      "Only one man and woman survived. They had seen the war getting worse and worse. They had tried to urge their leaders to talk to the other side, but none would listen. At last, the couple hid themselves deep in the earth by a stream with enough food to last many days, and so they were spared. After the great fire, they were the only human beings left alive on earth.",
      "\n",
      "From the safety of their hole in the ground they could see the flames licking the air.\u00a0 They could smell the smoke still raging outside. After several days, when the worst of the great fire's destruction had settled down, the man crawled to the surface.\u00a0 ",

For eight more days they tried.\u00a0 On the tenth day, the twig did not burned nor smolder. With care, they came out of their hiding place to the surface.",

Dorani had a friend who was a fairy, and both Dorani and her fairy friend were able to sing more sweetly and dance more gracefully than anyone else in the kingdom. For this reason they were held in high favor by the king, or rajah, of fairyland.\u00a0 And the rajah's name was Indra.",
      "\n",
      "Dorani had the loveliest hair in the world, for it was like spun gold, and the smell of it was like the smell of fresh roses. But her hair was so long and thick that the weight of it was often unbearable.\u00a0 One day she cut off a shining tress.\u00a0 Wrapping the hair in a large leaf, she threw it in the river which ran just below her window.",

He opened it, and within he found a lock of hair like spun gold, and from which came a faint, exquisite fragrance.",
      "\n",
      "When the prince reached home that day he looked so sad and was so quiet that his father wondered if any ill had befallen him, and asked his son what was the matter. ",
      "\n",
      "The youth took the tress of hair which he had found in the river.\u00a0 Holding it up to the light, he replied, \"See, my father, was there ever hair like this? Unless I can win and marry the maiden that owns that lock of hair, I must die!\"",
      "\n",
      "So the king immediately sent heralds throughout all his dominions to search for the damsel with hair like spun gold. At last he learned that she was the daughter of the perfume merchant. ",

      "\n",
      "The king thought this a very strange request but said to himself that it was, after all, his son's affair, and the girl would surely soon tire of going to and fro. So he made no difficulty, and everything was speedily arranged and the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing.",
      "\n",
      "At first, the condition attached to his wedding with the lovely Dorani troubled the prince very little, for he thought that he would at least see his bride during the day. But to his dismay, he found that she would do nothing but sit the whole time upon a stool with her head bowed forward upon her knees, and he could never persuade her to say a single word. ",
      "\n",
      "Each evening she was carried back to her house on a covered platform that was carried on poles on the shoulders of four men, a transport called a palanquin. Each morning Dorani returned soon after daybreak; and yet never a sound passed her lips, nor did she show by any sign all day long that she saw, or heard, or heeded her husband.",
      "\n",
      "Unhappy and troubled, the prince was wandering in an old and beautiful garden near the palace when he came upon the old gardener, who had served the prince's great grandfather. When the old gardener saw the prince he came and bowed before him and said, ",

Night after night she leaves me for her father's house, and day after day she sits in mine as though turned to stone, and utters no word, whatever I may say or do.\"",
      "\n",
      "The gardener asked the prince to wait for him.\u00a0 A little later he came back with five or six small packets, which he placed in the young man's hands.\u00a0 He said, \"Tomorrow, when your bride leaves the palace, sprinkle the powder from one of these packets upon your body. While continuing to see everything clearly yourself, you will become invisible to everyone else. More I cannot do, but may all go well for you!\"",

Indeed he was invisible to everyone else, although he felt as usual, and could see all that passed before him. He speedily caught up with the palanquin and walked beside it to the perfume merchant's dwelling. There his bride entered the house.\u00a0 He followed silently behind her.",
      "\n",
      "Dorani proceeded to her own room where were set two large basins, one filled with rose oil perfume and one of water. In these she washed herself, and then she arrayed herself in a robe of silver, and wound about her neck strings of pearls, while a wreath of roses crowned her hair. When fully dressed, she seated herself upon a four-legged stool over which was a canopy with silken curtains. These she drew around her.\u00a0 Then she called out, \"Fly, stool, fly!\"",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the stool rose up in the air.\u00a0 The invisible prince, who had watched all these proceedings with great wonder, seized it by one leg as it flew away, and found himself being borne through the air at a rapid rate.",
      "\n",
      "In a short while they arrived at the house of Dorani's fairy friend, who, as I told you before, was also a favorite with the king, or rajah, of fairyland. The fairy stood waiting on the threshold, as beautifully dressed as Dorani herself was.\u00a0 ",
      "\n",
      "When the stool stopped at her door, the fairy friend cried in astonishment -",

      "I suspect that you have been talking to your husband, so it will not fly straight.\"",
      "\n",
      "But Dorani declared she had not spoken one word to him, and she couldn't think why the stool flew as if weighed down at one side. The fairy looked doubtful, but made no answer, and took her seat beside Dorani, the prince again holding tightly to one leg. Then the stool carried both on through the air until it came to the palace of Indra the rajah.",
      "\n",
      "All through the night the women sang and danced before the rajah Indra, while a magic lute played by itself the most bewitching music the prince had ever heard, and the prince was quite entranced. Just before dawn the rajah gave the signal to cease. Again the two women seated themselves on the stool and, with the prince clinging to one leg, it flew back to earth, and bore Dorani and her husband safely to the perfume merchant's shop.",
      "\n",
      "Here the prince hurried straight on to the palace. As he passed the threshold of his own rooms he became visible again. Then he lay down upon a couch and waited for Dorani to arrive.",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she came, she took a seat and remained as silent as usual, with her head bowed on her knees. For a while not a sound was heard.\u00a0 Presently the prince said, \"I dreamed a curious dream last night, and as it was all about you I am going to tell it to you, although you heed nothing.\"",

      "The girl, indeed, did not respond to his words and stayed as still ever.\u00a0 But in spite of that, he proceeded to relate every single thing he had seen the evening before, leaving out no detail. And when he praised her singing - and his voice shook a little - Dorani just looked at him, but she said naught, though in her own mind, she was filled with wonder.",
      "\n",
      "\"What a dream!\" she thought. \"Could it have been a dream? How could he have learned in a dream all I have done?\" Still she kept silent.\u00a0 Only she looked that one time at the prince, and then remained all day as before, with her head bowed upon her knees.",
      "\n",
      "When night came, the prince again made himself invisible and followed her. The same things happened again as had happened before, but Dorani sang better than ever. In the morning the prince a second time told Dorani all that she had done, pretending that he had dreamed of it. Directly after he had finished Dorani gazed at him.\u00a0 She said, \"Is it true that you dreamt this, or were you really there?\"",
      "\n",
      "\"I was there,\" answered the prince.",

      "This time Dorani's eyelids quivered but she said no more, and was silent the rest of the day. However, in the evening, just as she was stepping into her palanquin, she said to the prince, \"If you do love me, prove it by not following me tonight.\"",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "One day, a very old woman who was known to understand such goings-on came to the widow's house. The widow offered the old woman tea and sweets and asked her why no suitors came to call.",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly it is hard to say,\" said the old woman, \"yet it can only mean one thing. One of your daughters must be ill-fated. As long as she stays in the house, no suitors will come to call.\"",
      "\n",
      "The widow gasped. \"That cannot be!\" Then she said in barely a whisper, \"Which one?\"",

      "\n",
      "As darkness fell and her three daughters went to bed, the widow dreaded what she must do. First she visited her oldest daughter's bed and saw that she was sleeping soundly on her back. Then she went to her middle daughter's bed and saw that she was sleeping on her stomach. The widow, her heart pounding, ventured to her youngest daughter's bed. There with horror she saw that her dear youngest daughter Elena, breathing evenly, was sleeping on both of her hands.",
      "\n",
      "The widow felt weak. She sat on the bedside and wept silently. Her tears fell on Elena's hands and the girl awakened.",

      "\n",
      "\"Then I must go,\" said the girl firmly. Her mother protested, saying what the old woman had said was probably nothing at all. But no matter what the mother said, the girl continued to pack. At last, seeing she could not stop her daughter from leaving, the mother packed for her a large basket of food and kissed her on the cheek. As the mother sadly watched Elena walk away, suitors approached the house with gifts for her sisters.",

      "\n",
      "With hope, Elena left for the distant mountains. After a long journey, she arrived at the one where all the fates of the world lived. Some of the fates were lovely to look at, others as hideous as could be. \"Are you my fate?\" Elena asked each one in turn. Some politely smiled \"no.\" Others scoffed and laughed at her. She went on, one after another.",

      "Finally she saw a fate that looked somewhat like her, but her face was grotesquely twisted. Her hair was wild and she stared at Elena, making her very uncomfortable.",

Elena offered her some bread, but the creature cursed her and threw handfuls of dirt in her face. When the bizarre creature was laughing so loudly her mouth was wide open, Elena quickly threw a piece of bread that landed in her mouth. As the hideous fate chomped on the bread, her face softened.
